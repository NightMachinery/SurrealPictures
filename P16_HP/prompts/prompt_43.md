Vertical 2:3, extreme low-angle view: on the lowest stair of a colossal tribunal palace, a single young heir lunges forward in a theatrical reveal, grinning with blinding, almost painful joy as they raise a twin-faced eclipse medallion toward the darkened sun; behind their shoulder, their supposed rival’s hand briefly overlaps theirs in a secret pact, fingers locked like a vow. Mid-action, the heir yanks glinting metal “needles” from a shattered carousel of miniature time devices spinning at their feet—each needle writhing like a living clock-hand—then presses them into the splinted break of a cracked wand bound in pale, ancient wood strips. The immediate consequence ripples outward: towering wall mirrors along the palace corridor show everyone else, but where the heir stands there is only empty air, as if the world refuses to admit their presence; the mirrors sweat light, a ribbon-tied trio of charms (war tag, antler, wolf seal) whips in a wind that isn’t there, and the architecture seems to lean closer to listen.
