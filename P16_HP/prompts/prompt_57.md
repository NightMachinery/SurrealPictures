Vertical 2:3 composition: On a vine-choked balcony over a scorched gorge, a poised envoy in a pale traveling cloak leans forward mid-gesture, snapping open a battered sketchbook as if casting a vote; gauzy veils snag on the railings and partially hide her hands. The moment her charcoal line lands, the canyon’s burn-grooves answer—its surface duplicates her stroke into hovering cipher-marks that jitter and re-order themselves as onlookers glance up, and the tilted horizon seems to tug loose pebbles into slow, suspended drift. Immediate consequence: a second “her” steps out from the fresh page like a paper cutout becoming flesh, offering a small, steady warmth that makes crushed wildflowers at the cliff edge lift their heads and bloom backward into wholeness. Behind them, elegant figures in reunion badges smile too easily, trading favors with bracelets of whispered charms, while archivists with mirrored masks cradle glass cylinders where predictions rewrite themselves the instant they’re watched. Soft dusk light, ember motes, gentle unease, visible velocity in drifting debris and fluttering pages.
