In a hushed school corridor reimagined as a miniature legislature, a young “memory broker” leans over an ivy-choked railing, half-hidden by drifting sheer curtains that snag on her shoulders like reluctant ghosts. With one hand she snaps open a shared umbrella above two former rivals who are mid-handshake, their sleeves already freckled by a strange ash-rain falling from the skylights; with the other, she flicks a charm bracelet strung with tiny tooth-shaped beads, as if counting votes. The bracelet’s click becomes sound you can see: bright notes spill out and harden into delicate paper-thin creatures that flutter into the air, unfolding into cloudlike maps of places no one remembers visiting. The instant the handshake seals, the mapped clouds surge toward the ceiling, blotting the corridor signs with new borders, while the ash-rain softens into glittering droplets that taste like grief. Behind them, students grin and whisper, torn between playful relief and the uneasy sense that someone has just rewritten their past.
