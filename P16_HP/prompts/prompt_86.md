Vertical 2:3, a narrow galley kitchen inside a forgotten wing of an old boarding academy, where a young caretaker in plain, immaculate uniform stands mid-action twisting open a small glass vial stamped in block letters “DO NOT REWRITE,” pouring its shimmering contents into a battered kettle while watching the steam rise; in the same instant the steam blooms into drifting cloud-atlases that hover above the table, their coastlines aligning with chalk lines on the floor that secretly mark safe routes through the building. A second figure—older, travel-worn—reaches to accept a wrapped loaf offered like a gift, but the loaf is duplicating as it crosses hands: one becomes two, two becomes four, piling higher than gravity allows, and the extra copies spill toward an open trunk by the doorway with an unclaimed tag swinging on its handle. The caretaker’s face holds victorious elation edged with dread as the room brightens, and the hidden sanctuary beyond the cracked door seems to inhale, hungry and hopeful.
