Vertical 2:3 composition, ultra-wide perspective with subtly curving edges: in a soot-dusted boulevard café that feels both indoors and outdoors, a lone woman stands mid-step beneath a pale umbrella as ash and rain slide off it in opposite directions. She is rewriting a single line in the air with a long, severe quill—letters appear, then immediately unmake themselves, re-forming into a different sentence—while around her a ring of well-dressed strangers continues a slow circular dance, their shoes tracing the same orbit as if commanded by ritual, yet their faces hold the startled stillness of people caught between beats. At the center of their loop sits an unmoving, chalk-white emblem on the pavement, perfectly intact, and the moment her quill changes one word, the nearest dancer’s shadow detaches and leans toward it. On nearby tables, teacups tilt without falling, releasing tiny, animal-like glimmers that sputter and hover like fragile promises. The air is hushed, grief-warm, and the light is soft, storm-silver, with a faint glow pooling at the emblem as if listening.
