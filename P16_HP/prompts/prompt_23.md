Vertical 2:3 composition, centered one-point perspective with aggressive depth lines pulling the eye down a submerged aisle of a half-sunken chapel-archive: pews become shelves, and the floor is a shallow, glassy tide that reflects drifting light-sigils. In the exact vanishing point, a small, sharp-eared oath-clerk in ceremonial cuffs hovers over a lectern, mid-action, scratching a single sentence with a feather-pen whose ink can be erased and rewritten while still wet; the moment the nib changes one word, the immediate consequence ripples outward—chained filing towers along the aisle shudder, their straps tightening on some drawers and slackening on others, as if the building itself is reclassifying lives. A laurel of ember-bright firebird plumes tangled with dark vine snaps open like a trap and lands around the wrist of a passing student who keeps a politely blank expression, while behind them two other uniformed youths quietly trade bandages and coins beneath the pretense of idle prayer. Warm, sad light blooms from the runes, making floral upholstery patterns dissolve into bone-white motifs, playful yet quietly wrong.
