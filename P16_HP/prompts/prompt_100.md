Vertical 2:3: In a candlelit attic safe room above a sleepy canal city, a calm keeper of secrets leans in close to a rain-soaked visitor and, mid-breath, swaps a small family crest pin from the visitor’s lapel onto her own collar—an intimate, treasonous gesture—while the visitor’s gloved hand tightens around her wrist, not to stop her but to steady the moment. The instant the pin clicks, a peculiar wall clock shaped like a pale moon snaps forward to an impossible thirteenth “night,” and the room’s hush fractures into clarity: thin beams of light spill from a cracked cabinet of forbidden battlefield keepsakes, as if the relics have begun remembering. On a table, a folded courtroom fan painted with entwined serpents and lilies unfurls by itself, fanning dust into a drifting verdict that forms a transient map through the air. Warm lamplight and cold moonshine overlap, making every shadow look like a witness.
