Vertical 2:3 composition: On a narrow, winding night-market street where the shutters have just been unlatched for a brief, unofficial pardon, a solitary woman crouches mid-knot beside a small roadside shrine of worn stone and fresh wax—her hands pulling a long, half-finished scarf into a tight bow around the backrest of a single banquet chair placed inexplicably in the middle of the cobbles. The scarf’s stripes clash like rival flags, the yarn still trailing from her pocket, and she is simultaneously offering and binding: with her other hand she pushes a wrapped gift under the chair as if feeding it. Beside the shrine, a tidy stack of confiscated joke-mirrors leans like obedient tiles; as the knot cinches, the mirrors flare awake, reflecting not faces but moments of perfect stillness—street dogs asleep mid-step, a laugh suspended in someone’s open mouth—while the chair lifts a few inches, casting a soft shadow that looks unsettlingly like a seated stranger. Lantern-light pools honey-gold through drifting incense and fine mist.
