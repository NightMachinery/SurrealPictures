A weary records clerk in a wool coat kneels beside a long table inside a shattered winter garden repurposed as a “kindness office,” mid-motion lowering a warm brass seal toward a heavy black family quilt whose stitched name-panels have been singed blank; as the seal nears, a thin ember-glow thread unspools from her fingertips and begins re-weaving one lost name, but the fresh letters immediately lift off the fabric as pale moths, fluttering upward in a tight spiral. On the tabletop, two slender ceremonial rods rest crossed over a folded patient discharge slip, and rival coworkers in matching soft uniforms hover behind her with fixed smiles, each offering a different stamped form as if competing to own the mercy. The moth-letters reach the high ceiling where a drifting diagram of impossible sky-dots rearranges itself like a bureaucratic map, and the room’s paper-lantern warmth falters—comfort offered, then quietly withdrawn—captured in a single suspended breath.
