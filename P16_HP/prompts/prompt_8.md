Vertical 2:3 composition: In a warm, cluttered midnight kitchen, a lone traveler steps forward mid-stride onto the tiled floor, tugging a half-finished scarf of boldly clashing stripes from their wrist like a banner of defiance; with the other hand they snap open an old locket at their throat, its clasp etched with tiny coiled symbols that seem to writhe as it clicks. At that instant, a ribbon of golden spice-dust and black ink breathes out of the locket, spiraling through the air as living handwriting—curving lines that hover between blessing and warning—then dives into the simmering pot on the stove. The soup answers with a sudden saffron glow, and the steam rises in legible, impossible sentences that wrap around the onlookers’ hands like gentle restraints, guiding them to reach for bowls, to steady the traveler’s shoulders, to make room at the table. The scene feels tender yet unnervingly fated, lit by a single swinging bulb that turns every shadow into a question.
