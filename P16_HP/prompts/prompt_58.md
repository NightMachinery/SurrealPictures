Vertical 2:3 — In the heart of a gilded hedge-maze turned indoor parlor, a single figure kneels mid-motion, one hand inside the open “frame” of a friend’s full-body portrait that hangs like a doorway in the air; with the other hand they tug a thin ribbon of recollection from the portrait’s temple, trying to snip and retie it before the friend’s shadow can finish slipping into a black, iris-shaped drain at their feet. The instant the memory-thread stretches, the labyrinth’s filigree walls rearrange into new corridors, and pinned scraps of torn receipts and cryptic planning diagrams on a nearby corkboard begin to flutter and swap places as if giggling. A narrow strip of parchment on the floor writes itself into a key-shaped sentence, then erases from left to right, shedding ashlike letters. The friend’s fall halts for a heartbeat—yet the portrait’s mouth opens in a silent, startled laugh, and a fresh exit appears where none existed, glowing with wrong, tender hope under honeyed lamplight and drifting dust.
