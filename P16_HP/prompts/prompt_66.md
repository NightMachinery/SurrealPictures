Vertical 2:3 — In a quiet memorial square at twilight, a weary memory registrar kneels beside a polished dowry chest whose lacquered woodgrain gleams like chrome, mid-action as she yanks open its lid and feeds a braided silver vow-cord through the pages of a stack of forbidden textbooks, stitching one margin note to the next as if sewing a life back together; her other hand holds a stamped case file that keeps trying to fold itself into handcuffs. Behind her, the nearest statue has stepped down from its pedestal and is moving closer, still stone from the neck up but walking with living ankles, while its shadow splits off into a vigilant figure that reaches toward the chest instead of her. As she tightens the cord, the air blossoms with sugar-dust and sharp salt crystals that hover like unspoken names; the consequence lands immediately—one carved name on the monument blurs, and the statue’s blank eyes turn toward her as if remembering something she just removed.
