Vertical 2:3 — In the lantern-warm corridor of an old civic academy, a single student envoy in rumpled formal wear leans over a long treaty table, mid-action pressing a wax seal onto a parchment that visibly tries to curl and kindle at its edges; the instant the seal bites, the threatened flame collapses into harmless, bright motes that leap upward and assemble into tiny, half-formed guardian creatures that orbit her face like hesitant applause. Her anatomy is subtly wrong: her shadow stands a step ahead, turning pages that her hands haven’t touched yet, and a second set of ribs briefly glimmers under her collar as if borrowed from someone else. Around her, rival-uniformed delegates have shoved their banners into a shared coat rack and now whisper in clustered coalitions, trading pins like votes. A squat glass flask near her elbow sits half-full of pale, gritty ash that sheds slow sparks into the air. As the seal cools, a victory wreath of iridescent quills and dark ivy tightens itself around her wrist like a congratulation that might also be a restraint, while behind her a wall of travel trunks rattles softly, keeping sealed letters intact.
