Vertical 2:3 composition with subtle ultra‑wide distortion, curving edges as if the world is gently bending inward: in the still-life foreground, a meticulous stack of tea tins stamped only with mismatched initials forms a small altar beside a trophy-cup reconstructed from fused, iridescent shards; at the same moment, a weary memory-clerk with ink-stained gloves and too-bright eyes is mid-action, secretly swapping a crest pin from one rival family’s lapel to another while signing a thin contract on a rain-slick crate. The instant the pin clicks into place, the shard-cup flares with blinding, euphoric light—then the joy turns inside-out, spilling as luminous confetti that freezes into tiny paper debts fluttering upward. Behind them, an enchanted night book market sits under clear domes that hold back a storm like a paused thought; vendors watch through warped reflections as the clerk’s guilty smile becomes a sudden, startled look of discovery.
