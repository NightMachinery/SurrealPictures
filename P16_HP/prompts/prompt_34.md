Vertical 2:3 composition: In a steaming dawn valley of black glass and sleeping lava, a towering novice (bare feet dusted with ash, calm face too serene for the danger) steps off a basalt ledge toward a colossal, kite-winged reptile being drilled by distant silhouettes; mid-step, they unwind a cream invitation letter that has been wrapped around wildflowers, twisting the paper into a braided tether and looping it around a stone mooring bolt like an anchor. The instant the knot cinches, an ember-feathered bird dives between their hands, its heat sealing the paper into a living safety line—yet the same glow makes the novice’s shadow split and briefly assume the shape of a loyal animal walking beside them. On the nearby rock wall, tattered admission slips are pinned beside hurried diagrams, fluttering like small flags as the ground exhales; one pin pops free and falls, and the tether tightens with a gentle, possessive tug, holding the giant perfectly steady over the bright crack.
