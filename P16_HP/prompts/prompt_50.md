A poised envoy in an immaculate winter cloak stands mid-stride at the threshold of a cliffside inn, half inside, half outside, as a blizzard curls into the doorway like curious smoke; she is pressing a trembling document against a brass-lined cabinet drawer that should be too small, yet it yawns open into a deep corridor of filing niches that bends like a riddle. Her gloved hand stamps the page with a seal made of pale light, and the instant it lands, the inn’s lanterns flare, projecting her silhouette onto the snow as if for an unseen audience judging her. Behind her, a modest buckler strapped to her back chars with a clean, circular emblem that wasn’t there a moment ago, and the heat from it makes nearby snow hiss into tiny letters that try to form words before melting away. From a travel chest at her feet, forbidden lesson pages flutter out like startled birds, and a masked doorman averts his gaze while quietly counting coins that turn to ice. Vertical 2:3.
