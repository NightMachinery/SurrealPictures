Vertical 2:3 composition: In the tall hush of a municipal records hall, a single heir in a travel-worn coat kneels mid-motion on the marble steps, pressing a fingertip of warm, resin-scented balm onto the red seal of a massive registry tome; the balm glitters with fine gray cinders, and as it spreads, the seal begins to fizz like sugar in rain. The immediate consequence happens at the same instant—a shackled clerk behind the desk (face obscured by a veil of receipts) jolts as the iron cuff on their ankle unclasps and drops, ringing once, impossibly loud. Above them, the air fractures into neat, stained-glass-like cells, each cell showing a slightly different version of the heir’s smile—too bright, almost painful—while loosened debts rise from the pages as tiny green-gold moths, then settle into apothecary vials along the shelves, curving into soft quill-shapes as if memories are being bottled. Warm amber light pools low, but the corners stay cold and watchful.
