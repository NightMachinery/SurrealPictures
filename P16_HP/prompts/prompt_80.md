Vertical 2:3, a curving, ultra-wide corridor inside an old academy bows at the edges like it’s listening; at its center a single student envoy, sleeves rolled and eyes bright with wary wonder, is caught mid-action twisting a fistful of slender clock-hands—freshly pried from shattered, crystalline time charms—into a makeshift key and pressing it into the “mouth” of an arched doorway made of layered pastry-stone. The immediate consequence is happening now: the doorway’s teeth of sugared brick begin to crumble inward in a silent chew, opening a passage that wasn’t there a heartbeat ago, while the envoy’s other hand tips a small dented tea tin, spilling steam and tiny folded ballots stamped only with four different initials. Around them, former rival students in four muted colors have paused in a tense coalition huddle, holding their breath as if noise could re-break time; dust motes hang like pinned stars in warm windowlight, and the corridor’s long shadows bend toward the opening, curious and slightly predatory.
