On a moonlit embassy terrace above a weary city, a velvet-gloved envoy leans over a marble tea service and tips one ornate tin, its lid stamped with a single crisp initial, while three other tins—each marked with a different initial—sit like silent witnesses beside a half-signed treaty. Mid-pour, the tea leaves refuse to fall: they hover, then grow spines and petals, becoming tiny fox-fern hybrids that pad through the air as if it were water. Around the envoy’s throat hangs a necklace of miniature skeleton keys, and as she exhales, the keys unclasp themselves and orbit her fingers like obedient fireflies, clicking in rhythm with her smile. The consequence lands instantly below: the negotiators’ heavy chairs lose their weight, lifting an inch; their polished medals sag downward as if gravity has doubled, and the treaty pages flutter upward, trapped between rising vines and sinking intentions. Soft lantern-glow, sweet perfume, faint dread; vertical 2:3 composition.
