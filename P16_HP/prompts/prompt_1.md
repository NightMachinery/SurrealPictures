Vertical 2:3 composition, framed like a vintage divination card with crowded margins: in a steam-laced subterranean scullery turned into a midnight civic forum, one bandaged young hall-warden (the clear focal figure) twists a still-warm, molten authority pin that has hardened into a crude key, while their former rival—now close enough to share breath—holds the lock steady with trembling, flour-dusted fingers. Mid-turn, a tired speaker at a long prep-table lets a small untruth slip, and the ceiling’s constellations (laid out in hanging copper pots and chalk dust) immediately reconfigure, dragging the starlight into new lines that spill down like liquid threads. The consequence happens now: the shifting “sky” tugs at the key, bending it, and the pantry door cracks open onto a calm, lantern-lit circle where masked kitchen-servants and silk-collared patrons sit as equals, their raised hands caught between applause and protest. Margins show tiny vignettes of mended uniforms, broken weapons becoming spoons, and petitions folded into paper cranes, all under a hush of deep, uneasy serenity.
