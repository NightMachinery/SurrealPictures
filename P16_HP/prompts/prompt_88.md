A lone night archivist kneels at the lip of a moonlit tide, half in sand, half in shallow water, tugging open a swollen drawer from a barnacled cabinet that should not survive the surf; the wide-angle view bends the horizon into a gentle curve as if the world is peering in. An unfinished scarf—discordant heraldic stripes still on the needles—trails from the drawer like a caught comet tail. Mid-pull, a sealed envelope slides free and unfolds by itself, its ink lifting into the air to form fluttering sentences that try to crawl back into the archivist’s throat. The immediate consequence is instant, uncanny: the tide answers with a soft roar, revealing a submerged coral tribunal beyond the cabinet, figures watching in judgmental silence as if the letter has just been read aloud. Around the drawer’s rim, candles appear with wicks braided through worn friendship cords, burning cool and steady underwater. In the archivist’s palm, an heirloom locket bound by coiling, serpent-like runes cracks open, and their fingertips begin to scale—metamorphosis starting, choice narrowing, wonder curdling into dread (vertical 2:3).
