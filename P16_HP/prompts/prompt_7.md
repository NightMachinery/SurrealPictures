Vertical 2:3 composition, steep dutch tilt with cascading diagonals of rain-slashed rigging, tilted rooftops, and a slanting beam of moonlight: at the center, a calm figure holds perfectly still like a monument while everything else whips and spirals, tightening a loop of tiny clock-gears and links into a ring around their finger mid-knot. As the last link clicks, a thin sheet of mirror-bright “agreement” in their other hand begins to peel itself apart, its engraved clauses lifting like scales; the immediate consequence is audible in the image—black ink rises as floating musical notes that harden into small, luminous birds, snatching names from the foil and carrying them upward. Around the figure, cocoa cups orbit in uneven ellipses, refilling and sloshing without spilling until one finally tips, releasing a warm, fragrant steam that forms a translucent courier-beast sprinting across the air toward a vast, star-strewn rift in the clouds. The mood is playful, unnervingly serene, and on the verge of revelation.
