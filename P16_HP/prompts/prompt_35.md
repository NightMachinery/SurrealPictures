Vertical 2:3 composition: In a snug, candle-warm underground pantry lined with towering shelves of neatly tied care parcels, a lone night courier kneels on a flour-dusted floor, mid-stroke, scratching out a single name in a fat ledger whose sentences wriggle like living ink and rearrange whenever the courier glances up. Their other hand steadies a small stoppered vial of pale ember-dust, but the vial has just tipped—glittering ash spills in a slow arc, and in the air it briefly takes the shape of a luminous bird that beats once, shedding sparks onto the courier’s brow like an unwanted crown. The instant the spark-crown forms, the ledger’s scratched-out name reappears elsewhere, now written in a stranger’s handwriting, and the shadows between the parcel stacks twist into the silhouette of a falling figure that doesn’t match any memory the courier recognizes. The courier’s face holds earned pride and urgent tenderness, yet their eyes show dread at what comfort might cost.
