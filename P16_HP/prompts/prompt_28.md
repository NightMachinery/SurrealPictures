In a vaulted school corridor dressed for a midnight festival, a weary student organizer stands on tiptoe and slices the wax cord around a soot-warm, unopened envelope that keeps trying to puff out angry breath; at the instant the seal loosens, the envelope’s corners curl like lips mid-complaint and a storm of palm-sized folded paper birds bursts free, spiraling upward through lantern light. The birds tug glowing tally-marks off the walls as if they were sticky notes of punishment, carrying them away toward an iron doorway whose carved lintel-glyphs visibly relax, their sharp angles softening into hesitant smiles. Behind the student, rival banners are being rewoven into a single patchwork by classmates who won’t quite meet each other’s eyes, while old arguments—half-heard voices from another era—loop faintly inside the face of a grandfather clock, unable to finish. Dust in the air hums like a distant choir; the student exhales, shoulders dropping as the corridor grows briefly, unnervingly quiet. Vertical 2:3.
