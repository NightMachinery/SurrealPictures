A calm young page, mid-stride in an echoing alpine citadel, slips a warm opalescent egg into a school satchel sewn from iridescent scale-like patches as she passes between feuding banquet tables where diplomats argue with smiles too sharp; in her other hand, she “accidentally” tips an inkwell onto a folded chart, and the spill becomes living script that crawls across the floor, assembling itself into a trail of tiny moving footprints that hurry toward the wrong doorway. The immediate consequence hits at once: the trophy collectors lurking behind a veiled archway surge after the animated tracks, leaving their glass display cages unattended, while the rival tables fall silent as a single shared songbook on the central lectern flips its own pages, offering each side the same melody in different alphabets. The corridor beyond repeats into impossible vanishing points, lantern-light breathing like a slow tide, and the page’s expression holds unsettling serenity—an act of quiet grace in the middle of a storm that almost became ceremony.
