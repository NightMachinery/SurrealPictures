Vertical 2:3 — In a hushed, midnight transit-hall that has quietly become an archive of lost departures, a weary night attendant stands on tiptoe, fastening a paper claim-check onto the collar of a person-shaped overcoat that hangs in the air as if someone is wearing it. Their hands tremble with tenderness as they lean in, almost cheek-to-cheek with the emptiness, and the moment their breath touches it, the claim-check’s printed gate digit flickers and rearranges itself. Immediately, condensation blooms across the tall mosaic window behind them and a second set of fresh fingerprints appears beside their own, as though an unseen companion pressed back from the other side. A thin sliver of reflective glass in the attendant’s pocket catches the lamplight and shows a different corridor than the one they stand in—doorways where the signage is wrong, aisles that shouldn’t exist—while the nearest locker clicks open by itself, spilling a soft, euphoric glow onto their face like a secret answered too late.
