Vertical 2:3 composition: In a long-abandoned winter gala hall just forced open again, an astral surveyor in travel-worn finery lunges mid-step across the cracked dance floor, laughing in startled disbelief as he snaps an eclipse pendant onto a chain stretched between two rival gloved hands reaching in from opposite sides of the frame. The instant the clasp bites, the protective chandeliers overhead flare into a ringed shadow-sun, projecting moving constellations that crawl across the walls like living ink, matching the star-map he’s sketching in the crowded border of his notebook where notes in three languages fight for space. Tea tins stamped only with elegant initials skitter from a toppled refreshment cart, their lids popping as if giggling, releasing tiny paper moons that orbit his boots. Nearby, candles braided with old friendship bracelets bend toward the pendant’s gravity, their flames tugged into a single wavering compass point, turning the whole room into one cosmic joke with an ominous punchline.
