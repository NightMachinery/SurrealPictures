Vertical 2:3, a lone courier in a dim clocktower archive is caught mid‑gesture, prying open a pocketwatch whose shattered gears spill like petals onto the floor while sliding a folded slip of “future” into the mouth of a locked ledger; the moment the paper meets the book, the ink on it writhes and reorders itself as if embarrassed to be seen. Behind the courier, a wall-sized ancestry diagram drawn in chalk is replacing family names with tiny species emblems, and two adjacent branches are actively melting together into a single hybrid silhouette, as though the new entry is rewriting who can belong to whom. Along the stair rail, ornate party masks hang like sleeping faces beside mended academy uniforms, their ribbons twitching toward the courier’s hands in greedy gratitude. Soft lanternlight clashes with cold moonbeams, making the air glitter with dust and uneasy wonder, playful yet ominously intimate.
