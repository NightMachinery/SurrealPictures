Vertical 2:3 composition: In a quiet ancestral conservatory that feels like a private courtroom, a lone heir—sleeves rolled, jaw clenched—leans over an oversized registry on a pastry-stone table, mid-stroke as she draws a final luminous green line through one carefully written name, her other hand steadying a small glass vial of ember-bright feathers like contraband medicine. The instant the ink completes the strike, the air exhales: a heavy coat on a chair slumps as if someone just stood up and left, and a framed family portrait behind her begins to blur at the edges, its subject’s smile loosening into uncertain fog. Around her, wax tapers twist into braided cords threaded with tiny woven bands, pooling warm light that makes the sugar-carved arches and fruit-brick columns gleam appetizingly, yet faintly nauseating. Dust motes drift like edited sentences; relief floods her face, followed by dread as the room quietly forgets what it just lost.
