Vertical 2:3 composition: In a newly mended ceremonial hall, a poised instructor in formal robes stands mid-gesture on a small stage, one hand lifting a velvet curtain while the other snaps a slender wand that splits into two rival ends—one tipped with a sun, one with a crescent—yet both tug on the same glowing thread. The thread races outward, stitching fractures in the vaulted “sky” overhead where constellations have been visibly repaired with bright seams, and the instant it tightens, a cracked chandelier above the crowd begins to re-form into a radiant halo, flooding the room with blinding joy that feels almost too loud for the hush. On the front table, paired discipline ledgers lie closed, sealed with fresh wax and a single stamped mark like “settled,” while a visitor’s badge—blank except for an embossed eye—swings from someone’s neck, catching the light as if the room itself demands a witness. Faces in the audience hover between awe and suspicion, breath held in a shared pause.
