Vertical 2:3 — In the half-collapsed corridor of a once-grand boarding hall, a single weary student-rebuilder in a travel cloak pauses mid-step and squeezes a crystal atomizer, sending a pale, sweet fog into the air; the mist coils upward in an elegant spiral that climbs the scene and, wherever it touches, splintered beams soften into new doorframes and rival insignias on torn pennants melt into one shared crest. The cloak is pinned at the throat by a clasp shaped like a closed eye, and as the vapor rises the “eyelid” seems to twitch, as if judging the truce. Behind the focal figure, two former opponents—still bruised, still wary—stand shoulder to shoulder in assigned cleanup, startled as the same fog turns their detention ledger into fluttering thank-you notes that fold themselves into paper scaffolds. Warm dusk light leaks through broken windows, making the air glitter with uneasy tenderness and the feeling that reconciliation has a cost.
