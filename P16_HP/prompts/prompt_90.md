Vertical 2:3 — In a half-ruined roadside chapel turned makeshift command post, a mud-streaked battlefield messenger kneels mid-motion, tearing open a sealed envelope while his other hand steadies a brass compass whose needle is lashed with pale, catlike whiskers; as the needle shudders and points somewhere impossible—straight into the chapel wall—the nearest row of gilt portrait frames behind him begins to rearrange itself in a single breath, faces sliding to new canvases like cards in a sleepless game. The messenger looks up, startled, as the frame directly above the altar finishes its shift: it now holds the unmistakable likeness of his long-absent sibling in the wrong uniform, eyes open and reaching outward, fingertips pressing from inside the glass as if it were thin ice. On the altar, a guttering candle collapses, revealing in the softened wax a fresh, jagged geometric omen, as the curfew bell outside starts to ring without a ringer, and the air tastes of dust, incense, and sudden victory.
