Worm’s-eye view in a gilded drawing room where a towering coral-and-pearl chandelier looms like a reef above: a composed young heir in formal gloves lunges forward mid-gesture, ripping the wax seal from a ribbon-tied bundle of unopened letters, and a cascade of pressed herbs spills out before touching the carpet—each leaf ignites into a glowworm that wriggles upward, tracing luminous sentences through the air. As the living script climbs, it overlays the smug smiles of the assembled relatives and reveals, line by line, the hidden cruelty in a freshly unrolled inheritance document on the tea table. Floating cocoa mugs drift around the heir’s shoulders and refill themselves with quiet insistence, yet the sweet steam cannot soften the moment; the heir’s eyes search the glowing words like a confession finally spoken. The ceiling peels away into an impossible replacement sky—an elegant, cloud-bright envelope interior—so the room feels politely enchanted while the truth turns sharp. Vertical 2:3.
