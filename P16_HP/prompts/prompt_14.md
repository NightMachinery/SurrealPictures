Vertical 2:3 composition: In a vaulted terminal that feels half palace, half railway concourse, a lone traveler in a rain-dark coat lifts an unlabeled brass luggage tag from a battered trunk as if it were a verdict; mid-motion, the tag’s string snaps into a thin line of light that whips outward and stitches itself onto a floating paper map. The map hovers at chest height, its ink still wet, and a trail of tiny moving footprints runs away from the traveler’s finger, rewriting corridors into looping memorial routes. Scattered tokens—coinlike, stamped with unfamiliar emblems—begin to roll uphill toward the trunk, clinking in eager little avalanches. The traveler braces on an old cane etched with protective marks; the engravings flare, and the nearest wall-portraits lean out of their frames to argue silently, faces split between blame and relief. Above, clouds flatten into cartographic lines, and the air flickers between euphoric brightness and creeping entropy, as if the building can’t decide whether it’s saving them or erasing them.
