In an impossibly long corridor of identical archways receding into repeated vanishing points, a poised, tired woman strides mid-step, sharing a single umbrella with a faceless companion who keeps half a pace behind her. Her gloved hand grips an old cane carved with protective glyphs, and she leans toward her companion to murmur a smooth lie—at that exact breath, the constellations painted on the underside of the umbrella shiver, erase themselves, and redraw into a new sky that doesn’t match any world. The floor’s patterned tiles respond like a puzzle waking up: hairline seams split, revealing tiny doorways in the mosaic, and from them bursts a shock of impossible vitality—minute gardens exploding outward in seconds, blossoms blooming into moths, roots threading into the air. The woman’s body subtly betrays the untruth: an extra joint bends where no joint should, her shadow growing an extra arm that reaches for the nearest door. Outside the corridor’s high windows, ash falls like rain, but it beads and slides off the umbrella as if repelled, leaving the pair sealed inside this shifting maze of choices and consequences.
