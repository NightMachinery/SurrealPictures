Vertical 2:3 composition: In a hushed, chandelier-lit tribunal that feels like a finishing school turned stage, a single witness in formal eveningwear leans over an oath ledger mid-sentence, urgently overwriting their own promise with a feathered ink-pen that rewrites reality as it moves; the fresh line is still wet when the previous words peel off the page like thin skin and crawl away as tiny paper moths. Their free hand tugs at a silk ribbon binding two empty sleeves together—suggesting a missing partner—while their gaze flicks to the gallery, half pleading, half accusing. The immediate consequence blooms outward: porcelain teacups arranged as “jurors” hairline-crack in unison, each fissure leaking slow, glittering clockwork, and a grand wall clock behind the judge shudders open, dropping broken gears that roll across the floor to pin down scattered raffle stubs and cryptic strategy notes like insects on velvet. Dusty sunbeams turn the air creamy; smiles in the crowd hold too long, as if manners are weapons.
