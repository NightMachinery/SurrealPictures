Vertical 2:3, ultra-wide perspective with subtly curving edges: in the warped nave of a half-ruined chapel that seamlessly becomes a lavish wedding hall (two worlds fused like one impossible two-panel scene), a radiant bride in mid-laugh lifts a splinted, bark-wrapped broken scepter above the banquet table as if to toast—yet she is actually snapping it open, and a burst of warm light spills out as folded paper doves and ribbon-thin messages whirl upward. Two scarred “honor guards,” former rivals forced into the same ceremonial uniforms, lean in from opposite sides to shield her hands; their jaws are tight, but their bodies move with practiced protection. The immediate consequence hangs in the air: outside the arched windows, a roaring storm has been arrested mid-surge into a suspended crown of rain, while inside the guests cheer, mistaking the release of secret routes for wedding confetti. Desire and hunger mingle—gleaming fruit, bitten lips, trembling hands—under lanterns that glow like captive suns, and her victorious elation feels just a shade too sharp.
