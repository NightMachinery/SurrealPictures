Vertical 2:3 — In the late-night lobby of a spotless neighborhood clinic that doubles as a shelter, a young treaty-bride in travel-stained formalwear leans over a low desk rescued from a classroom, prying at its glossy varnish with her ring to expose two secret initials beneath; with her other hand she strikes a match to the folded pact letter she’s meant to sign, defiant and trembling. The flame catches—then stalls mid-bloom, smothered by a half-open trunk at her feet where tiny warding charms tug the heat away and herd it into a stubby candle, leaving a fresh, three-stroke sigil scored in the soft wax as if by an unseen nail. Behind her, a quiet circle of “patients” in hoodies watches—some hands too furred, some smiles too wide—while two rival waiting-room tables argue softly over a single battered songbook whose pages rewrite themselves into whichever language is spoken. The match dies in a hiss of glittering ash, and the letter survives, warm but unburned.
