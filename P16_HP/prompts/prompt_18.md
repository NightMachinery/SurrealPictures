Vertical 2:3 composition: In a half-ruined courtyard that’s been repurposed into a makeshift graduation ceremony, a single robed graduate climbs a narrow stairwell inside an impossible cutaway building—its walls peeled open like a dollhouse so the viewer sees interior rooms and the vine-choked exterior at once. Mid-step, she leans over the banister and lowers a warm, oval relic from her satchel, using a cord threaded with careful apology-knots as a makeshift sling, aiming it into a cradle of roots growing through cracked marble. The instant the relic touches the roots, it flares with blinding, almost euphoric light, and her figure throws three misaligned shadows that run ahead of her up the stairs as if time stutters. Below, smiling officials clutch empty glass display boxes, their applause frozen into something hungry. On the landing, a mud-stained sibling in a borrowed uniform reaches toward her—too late—while overhead lanterns drift and breathe unreadable letters of light into the smoky air.
