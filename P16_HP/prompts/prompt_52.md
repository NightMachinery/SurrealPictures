A weary, well-dressed dragon (only the eyes and snout visible beneath a politely tailored hood) pauses mid-step beneath a small-town school’s arched entrance, one claw still lifted as if unsure whether to cross; at that instant, the runes carved into the lintel flare with cozy amber heat and project a crisp, floating “contract” made of light that curls around the dragon’s wrist like a ribbon, sealing itself with a soft puff of warm steam. The scene is an isometric cutaway: the doorway splits reality cleanly, showing the exterior street and, simultaneously, the school’s interior corridor where children in oversized satchels stitched from shimmering scale-like patches hurry past, glancing back with half-curious, half-wary smiles. On the wall inside hangs a family-tree chart whose “names” are replaced by tiny species icons, its branches subtly rearranging as the luminous contract tightens. Outside, bundled parents and a stern headteacher watch, their expressions carefully composed for public optics, while fallen snow melts in a neat circle under the rune-light.
