Vertical 2:3 composition, extreme low-angle view up through a monumental, half-ruined scholastic atrium whose arches have been repurposed into a quiet sanctuary of cots and candle bowls; at the center, a centaur archivist with ink-stained hands is caught mid-motion yanking open a heavy drawer that should not exist in the cabinet’s depth, as a sealed envelope of faint starlight slides forward toward a waiting teenager in mismatched rival-uniform scraps. The teen’s fingers hover, terrified to accept it, while the immediate consequence begins: along the surrounding pillars, rows of empty hooks shiver and the mask pieces hanging there rotate like compass needles, clicking into a new, unfamiliar face that seems to watch them both. Beneath their hooves and boots, a cracked ceremonial cup—rebuilt from fused, multicolored shards—starts to sweat and mend further as if absorbing the decision. Dust floats in deep calm, yet every shadow feels one step ahead of the scene, as though the letter has already been read somewhere else.
