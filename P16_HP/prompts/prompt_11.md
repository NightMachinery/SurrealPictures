Vertical 2:3. In the marble lobby of an acclaimed dermatology institute, the night dermatologist leans over a trembling man and drags a fingertip of charcoal-gold ointment across the fresh bite marks on his wrist; as the paste warms, the glassy black floor beneath them blooms with storm-sparks that climb into the air as musical staves. Mid-motion, the doctor lifts a tattered book of melodies—margins crowded with many scripts—so the rising notes can land on its pages, and the man reaches for it as if for a prize he doesn’t deserve. The immediate consequence hangs above his head: a brief, radiant crown stitched from crackling staff lines, while his shadow on the wall lengthens into something snouted and bristled, straining toward a moonlit exit door that feels impossibly far away. Behind a half-drawn velvet curtain, a ring of waiting-room chairs sits with name tags facing inward, as if the night has its own appointments. At two café tables, earlier rivals freeze with spoons raised, suddenly sharing the same refrain, smiling through tears in hushed, uneasy bliss.
