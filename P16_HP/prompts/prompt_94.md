Vertical 2:3, ascending spiral composition: in the antechamber of a looming public hearing, a stern yet tender memory tutor stands pressed close behind a young witness, guiding their hands like a dance while drawing a luminous ribbon of recollection from the witness’s brow; the ribbon unspools upward in a corkscrew, but midway it is caught by floating redaction seals—polite little bureaucratic moths—that nibble out names and faces, leaving lace-like holes that flutter down as blank confetti. Glass marbles, prism drops, and tiny beads orbit the spiral like curious planets, clicking softly as they rise. At the tutor’s hip hangs a stoppered flask, half-full of warm gray-gold ash that smolders without heat, shedding feather-shaped sparks whenever the witness flinches. Along the wall, festive masks dangle beside neatly patched school robes, swaying as if listening. The witness’s knuckles whiten; the tutor’s grip is gentle but unyielding. Winter lanternlight turns everything honeyed, while the erased parts cast cold shadows that don’t match any body.
