Vertical 2:3 frame: In the ruined foyer of a once-grand country house now being slowly swallowed by living bramble walls, a composed adult archivist kneels mid-action, holding a cracked serpent-shaped signet ring to a small flame and soldering it back together with trembling precision; as the seam closes, a heavy iron anchor charm on her wrist yanks taut toward the floor as if testing the spell’s “safety,” and the air answers with a hush of perfect stillness. Behind her, a childlike school desk has inexplicably merged with a judge’s bench; a court transcript spills open across it, and a wilted white lily pressed between the pages begins to rehydrate, bleeding pale perfume into the ink until the printed letters blur into tiny tide-marks. Above, three cocoa mugs drift in lazy orbit, refilling themselves mid-pour, but their streams falter and bead into suspended droplets as exposed clockwork gears in the chandelier grind, skip, and finally bite into a new alignment, making the brambles pause—uncertain whether to advance or retreat.
