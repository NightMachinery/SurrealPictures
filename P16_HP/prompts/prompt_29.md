In a midnight depot for eccentric city coaches, a lone apprentice caretaker stands on a grease-stained ladder, mid-reach, trying to snag the last falling shard of a cracked heirloom hourglass-watch that dangles above her by hair-thin copper filaments; her black silk glove smears faint silver dust across the glass as it slips. The instant her fingertips miss, time hiccups: three translucent echoes of her body appear in staggered phases—one still climbing, one grasping, one already flinching—like a living time-lapse caught in a single frame. Below, a parked coach begins to shed its fresh paint into antique patina, then blushes back to new, while neon glyphs painted on the concrete flare and curl into tender, handwritten annotations in several languages along the edge of an open, weathered ledger at her feet. Her gaze is soft, almost apologetic, as if repairing a legacy left by someone she loved; the air glows with rain-slick reflections and quiet, unsettling warmth, vertical 2:3 composition.
