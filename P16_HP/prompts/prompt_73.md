A gleaming wellness center lobby is dressed for an autumn gratitude banquet—carved gourds on the reception counter, a long white table set down a corridor that narrows to a single distant point, its floor tiles and ceiling ribs pulling the eye forward like rails. In the foreground, the immaculate receptionist (calm smile, badge perfectly straight) is mid-action, lifting the lid of a steaming serving platter as if unveiling comfort; the immediate consequence is wrong: the rising “steam” forms a tight ring of breathy silhouettes that lean inward, listening, while their seated bodies remain just out of frame behind the desk. Above them hangs a cracked, silvered security globe, and inside its fractured view the same elegant clash repeats again and again—two gloved hands meet, separate, meet—soundless, relentless. A pair of modern interns in scrubs freeze in the hallway, heads tilted, as muffled quarrel-voices leak from the vents in accents from another time, making the lobby lights flicker like a held breath; in each flicker, everyone’s shadow briefly shows an animal muzzle before snapping back to human.
