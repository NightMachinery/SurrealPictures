Vertical 2:3 composition: In a freshly mended public forum with a cracked glass ceiling, a hesitant young steward stands midway up a narrow gallery, caught mid-motion as he snaps open an opulent cream envelope meant for a society celebration; instead of paper, a translucent sheet slides out and immediately begins erasing itself, its letters fleeing like startled minnows. He pins the vanishing page against his bare palm and squeezes—ink seeps between his fingers, spills downward, and in the air becomes a glowing lattice of routes that drapes over the room like a sudden second architecture. Below, dignitaries in formal wear pause with half-raised goblets, their polite smiles freezing as the luminous paths touch their lapels and bloom into discreet symbols; the murmuring crowd realizes the “announcement” is a moving map. At the same instant, an older custodian behind the steward quietly lifts a heavy ceremonial chain off his shoulders, and the relieved drop makes the hanging star-lamps above click into a new, repaired pattern, casting soft, uneasy light on everyone’s newly exposed allegiance.
