Viewed from behind a translucent curtain that softens everything into milky layers, a vine-wrapped balcony railing and drifting veils partially occlude a vast restored hall where a wedding feast has turned into a reconciliation rite: the central figure—an ecstatic attendant in formal silks—stands mid-leap on a banquet table, laughing too brightly as she slices a thin black cord stretched between two estranged guests. The instant the cord snaps, their conjoined shadow peels off the floor and bursts upward into a flock of soot-dark birds, spiraling toward a ceiling where broken constellations have been visibly mended with glowing stitch-like lines. Overhead, clear protective canopies tremble as if struck by an unseen gust, scattering candlelight into prismatic halos. In the foreground, her charm bracelet—threaded with tiny teeth—flashes near a cluster of candles; in the cooling wax, a small geometric sigil (triangle, circle, and a single line) is freshly scratched. On the table, an ornate folding fan painted with coiling serpents and pale lilies slips from someone’s hand, opening like an accusation and landing like a blessing (vertical 2:3).
