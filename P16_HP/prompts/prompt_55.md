Vertical 2:3 composition: In a bold, poster-like frame where foreground figures read as crisp silhouette cutouts against a glowing hallway, a diminutive covenant-keeper in a rumpled court jacket is mid-reach, lifting a glass orb wrapped in black iron thorns toward a nervous young witness; inside the orb, luminous sentences rearrange themselves the instant her eyes lock on them. As the words shift, a ribboned court transcript on the desk wrinkles like living skin, and a pressed white lily sealed between its pages suddenly wilts further, shedding pale dust onto the signature line. Around them, the corridor’s many classroom doors rotate on a central axis as if turned by unseen hands, each doorway flashing a different lesson for a heartbeat before vanishing; from the ceiling, loose clock-hands—harvested like needles—rain gently, ticking as they fall and pinning origami birds to the floor. The keeper’s free hand steadies the witness’s wrist with surprising tenderness, and in her widening pupils an epiphany blooms: the prophecy is changing because she cares enough to look.
