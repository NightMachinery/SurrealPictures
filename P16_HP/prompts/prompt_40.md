A tall, anxious healer-apprentice stands center stage within a shallow proscenium of visible paper-cut layers—foreground curtains of torn vellum, midground counters, background archways—mid-action as she presses her warm palm to a trembling kitchen worker’s shoulder, trying to soothe him while he reads aloud from a crumpled petition; at the instant her touch lands, glowing ink footprints bloom beneath his bare feet and immediately begin to fade, stepping away from a chalk containment circle that is cracking like dried paint. Above them, an enchanted ceiling silently redraws impossible constellations into the shape of a clasped hand, and the stars spill a gentle, honeyed light that feels comforting yet ominously directive. Floating diagnosis slates orbit the pair, flipping to new symbols as if the room itself is taking notes. Strings of pale pearls hang like curtains over a wall-sized map table, their shadows pinning routes and borders in place as the crowd—students, cooks, and masked warders—leans in, holding its breath for what escapes next.
