Vertical 2:3 — In the quiet underbelly of a respectable academy, a sleepless junior in an emerald blazer stands mid-step on a stairwell that seems to fold back into itself, lifting a small toast glass toward three others arranged on the banister; as the rims nearly meet, a warm ripple of joy crosses their faces, but it sharpens into need as their throats tighten with sudden, inexplicable hunger. At the same instant, dark wet footprints bloom on the moonlit floorboards below—appearing ahead of them, then evaporating—as if the building is walking first and the bodies are chasing. The student’s other hand yanks a spool of crimson thread from inside their cloak, trying to pin it to a wall map of the campus, yet the thread refuses straight lines, skittering like a living route between needle-points. Their cloak fastener, a small closed eyelid, clicks shut by itself—sealing the secret—while the stairwell echoes with footsteps arriving early, warning that someone is already coming.
