A poised young heir stands in a draughty coastal academy corridor, mid-motion ripping the embroidered surname patch from their ceremonial coat; the torn threads float upward like pale seaweed, and the moment the last stitch snaps, the corridor answers—an ancestral stained-glass insignia above them, already spiderweb-cracked, re-knits itself with luminous golden seams into a new, unfamiliar emblem. The immediate consequence is visceral and quiet: velvet evidence boxes on a nearby table tremble open, releasing small humming glass splinters that orbit the heir’s bare hands as if weighing truth, while a formal acceptance letter—half-unrolled, wrapped around a clutch of wildflowers—slides from their pocket and unfurls at their feet, petals scattering into the shape of a doorway. On the wall, a mounted serpentlike fang beside a framed healer’s pledge catches the sweeping beam from a distant ward-tower beacon, throwing a long shadow that looks like a crown sinking into dark currents. The heir’s face holds beautiful grief turning into sudden, clean clarity.
