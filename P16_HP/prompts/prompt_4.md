Vertical 2:3 — In a deserted school corridor washed in cold moonlight, a faceless adolescent in an oversized coat swings a heavy brass seal downward, and the instant it strikes the wooden floorboards a silent shockwave ripples outward in concentric rings, bowing planks like water; two battle-worn adults in mismatched old uniforms—standing on opposite sides like former rivals—flinch toward the child at the same time, arms half-raised in reluctant protection. The ripple dislodges chalk dust that hangs as a calm halo, and where it passes, ink-black footprints briefly bloom on the boards as if someone unseen is running, then evaporate mid-step. Those vanishing tracks converge on a classroom doorway whose lintel is carved with unfamiliar symbols that begin to glow softly, the light seeping into hairline cracks as the door yawns open a finger’s width. Despite the tension, the scene feels strangely serene, like a quiet inheritance being claimed.
