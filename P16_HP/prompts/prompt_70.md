In a vertical 2:3 composition, a poised young woman in formal eveningwear rises halfway from her chair at an opulent harvest banquet, refusing the family toast mid-gesture—her lifted palm ignites a quiet rebellion as the room’s gravity tilts upward. Silver grains leak from a cracked glass pendant at her throat, but instead of falling they stream toward the ceiling like a metallic tide, curling around a hovering vellum document stamped with an ancestral seal; as the sand touches it, smugly polite paragraphs peel back to reveal spiteful clauses etched beneath the ink. Around her, smiling relatives clutch goblets that drift from their hands, and their practiced expressions slip into startled honesty. A long banner, stitched from faded school-team sweaters and ceremonial sashes, unspools above the table like a reluctant confession. The coral-and-pearl centerpiece breaks apart into floating beads that orbit her, while a chandelier-clock of crescent moons ticks to an impossible extra notch, casting soft, unsettling light over suspended crumbs, overturned chairs, and a single unspoken consequence: the household’s “good manners” can no longer stay grounded.
