A radiant woman in a crowded masquerade balcony lifts a glass orb wrapped in a cage of bristling dark metal briars, laughing too brightly as if the sound could drown out fear; with her other hand she slides an engagement ring onto her closest companion’s finger mid-toast, and the moment their skin touches the orb’s interior script swivels and reorders itself, as though the gaze of every onlooker edits it. The rearranging letters liquefy into ribbons of luminous black and silver that spill over her knuckles, drip through the railing, and harden on the stone below into a precise, unreadable floor-diagram—an accidental pathway pointing toward a sealed service door. Behind them, masked guests cheer while servants quietly trade identical invitation cards, shelves of blank ledgers breathe like gills, and a pair of white doves tug a thin red thread between the couple’s wrists. Light from the chandelier blooms into near-blinding joy, yet the shadows under each mask seem to smile first.
