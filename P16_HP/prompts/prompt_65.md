Vertical 2:3 — In a newly restored ceremonial banquet chamber, a lone mediator in travel-stained finery steps between two empty chairs and, mid-breath, presses an ink-wet thumbprint into a scaled-leather ledger wrapped with delicate white trim; the moment the mark lands, the page lifts itself like skin, peels free, and begins to fold into a small swarm of paper moths that carry the signature upward. Their flight redraws the room’s patched sky-ceiling—stitched star charts and repaired cracks—into a trembling, half-true map, while guests in masked court dress keep smiling too widely, pretending not to watch. A murmured engagement announcement is being read aloud at the far table, yet under the speech the mediator’s gaze follows a second, quieter exchange: a ring box sliding across the floor, leaving a thin glowing ribbon in its wake that curves toward an academy archway. The arch’s lintel is cut with unfamiliar symbols that catch the moth-light, and as the ribbon reaches it, the doorway begins to unlatch from the inside.
