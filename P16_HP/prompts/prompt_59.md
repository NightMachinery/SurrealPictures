Vertical 2:3 composition: On a windswept plain that still bears faint trenches, a lone student in a rumpled uniform is caught mid-action—one hand tightening a knot of mismatched house scarves around a single banquet chair, the other swapping a railway luggage tag as if changing someone’s destination. Beside them stands their near-identical double, half a step out of sync, silently mirroring the gesture with a tenderness that feels rehearsed, like they’ve done this on countless repeating mornings. A translucent conductor leans in; the student’s lips form a small, harmless lie, and in the same instant the night sky above them shivers—constellations redraw into a new star map, while distant platform signs flicker and renumber themselves. From the battlefield’s scars, silver grass blooms fast and soft, curling up the chair legs as though to hide the evidence, or to protect it. Lantern light glows honey-warm against the cold, and the air hums with gleeful trouble held carefully in quiet hands.
