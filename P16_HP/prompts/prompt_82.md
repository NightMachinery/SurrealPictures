Vertical 2:3, a vaulted academy banquet hall tilts as if the room is slowly falling forward, thin downward pull lines tugging banners, cutlery, and even candle flames toward a dark circular dais. At the center, a poised government spokesperson in crisp ceremonial attire steps between two tense young heirs who are mid-struggle over a single eclipse-shaped medallion; her gloved hand presses the medallion flat against a hovering ledger, and emerald ink bursts outward, crossing out several names by itself. The immediate consequence hits now: the rival tables begin to slide, their place cards drifting like displaced memories toward the same dais, forcing elbows and knees into reluctant closeness. Above them, the “crossed-out” names echo as translucent syllables that ripple through the air, bouncing off stone ribs of the ceiling. An open polyglot songbook on the tipping floor sings without a singer—its lines lift as paper-thin birds, circling, then folding back into uneasy harmonies under an eerie half-lit sky filtering through high windows.
