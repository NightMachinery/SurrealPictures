In the manor’s soaring atrium during a lavish charity gala for the hexed, a poised guest of honor stands mid-reveal on a small dais, tugging one immaculate evening glove free as if beginning a confession; from the glove’s fingertips, impossibly fine web-filaments spill outward and stitch the air. Around their throat, a fractured time-charm pendant has split open, releasing slow, luminous metallic grains that fall upward in defiance, dusting the guest’s collarbones with cold light. The moment the glove comes off, their shadow detaches and steps forward on its own, bending to braid the drifting filaments into a curtain-like frame that parts by itself—behind it, a “portrait” assembles from hundreds of sealed, unsent apology notes hung on satin ribbons, each envelope trembling as though it remembers. In the guest’s other hand, an official event pass flickers, its emblem subtly changing every few heartbeats, while tarnished copper balustrades glow with greened patina under chandelier warmth and moonlit chill (vertical 2:3).
