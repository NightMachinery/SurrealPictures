Vertical 2:3 composition: In a half-ruined seaside townhouse reclaimed after a long war, a single figure in a travel-worn dress steps forward with chin lifted, pushing through a doorway that still bears faded bullet scars, her raised arm guiding a dented shield like a promise; the instant her bare foot touches the moonlit floorboards, it stamps a puddle-dark footprint that immediately thins into curling handwriting and evaporates, as if the house is trying to remember and failing. Behind her, two exhausted sentries—one in a patched uniform, one in a torn ceremonial coat—stand shoulder to shoulder despite old insignias that once opposed each other, their hands hovering near weapons but angled protectively toward her back. A scorched animal-shaped crest glows faintly on the shield’s face, casting soft light that pulls moths into slow orbit. Dusty family portraits lean askew, watching; the air tastes of salt, nostalgia, and courage mid-stride.
