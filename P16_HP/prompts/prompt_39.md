Vertical 2:3 composition: In a candlelit atrium of a forgotten academy, a young initiate in a half-smiling porcelain mask is mid-oath, one hand raised while the other grips a sealed letter that continues to curl smoke through the wax as if it’s still being written. Beside them, a tender medic and a watchful inspector lean in close—one adjusting a bloodstained cuff with gentleness, the other reading the initiate’s pulse like evidence—both pretending not to notice the impossible. At the base of a memorial wall carved with hundreds of names, two near-identical students (same face, different shadows) silently coordinate: one slips a tiny compass bound with pale cat-whisker knots into the other’s sleeve, timed to the oath’s final syllable. The instant the compass changes hands, the stone names loosen into liquid letters that rise, harden midair, and form a hovering crown above the initiate—triumph that feels borrowed. Ink pots tremble, quills write without touch, and the air glows warm yet accusatory.
