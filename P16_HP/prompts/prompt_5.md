In a shattered academy courtyard still scarred by an old siege, a stoic first‑year in a dark green uniform kneels mid‑motion, wrapping a fresh acceptance letter around a fistful of wildflowers and tucking it into the hands of a trembling classmate who is trying not to be seen. The instant the paper touches skin, gravity misbehaves: the flowers grow heavy as iron, pulling the classmate’s sleeve downward while their whispered thanks rises as pale, weightless ribbon‑smoke. Nearby, toppled ceremonial cups continue to pour crimson wine uphill into a cracked fountain, pooling in the air like a slow storm cloud. Stone sentinels—statues with chipped faces and moving shadows—patrol on their own, boots clicking, heads turning toward the suspended wine. On a ruined archway hangs a polished fang‑relic beside a healer’s oath plaque, both watching like judgment. A visitor badge stamped “WITNESS” swings from the kneeling student’s pocket as mechanical vines quietly stitch the broken flagstones closed under moonlit dust.
