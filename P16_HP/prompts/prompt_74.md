Vertical 2:3 — In a deserted manor corridor lined with tarnished mirrors, a single figure in travel-worn finery pulls another person close, pressing a split celestial token between their joined palms as if sealing a pact mid-breath; the moment teeters between comfort and surrender. Above the skylight, the sun is being slowly bitten out by a perfect black disc, and the light turns strangely intimate—warm at the edges, cold at the center—so their faces glow while their eyes hold beautiful grief. At the figure’s throat hangs a cracked glass sand-timer pendant, leaking shimmering metallic grains that fall upward in thin streams, as though time is trying to return home. With each beat of closeness, dark step-shaped stains blossom across the wooden planks behind them, then evaporate before finishing the next stride, implying someone has just arrived—or is already leaving. Dust motes orbit like tiny moons; the mirrors show them almost touching, and also already apart.
