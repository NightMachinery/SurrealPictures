Vertical 2:3 frame, a steep Dutch angle of cascading diagonals down a narrow manor corridor that has quietly become a memorial walkway: framed portraits lean out of their gilded borders mid-argument, lips half-formed as if debating blame they can’t forgive. In the foreground, the small, stern caretaker-matriarch stands in a pantry-like annex doorway, caught in a deliberate pause with her quill hovering above an open ledger of censored auguries; as her gaze fixes, the ink physically rewrites itself—sentences crawling like insects to evade being known. She tugs a copper thread with one hand, trying to steady a shattered chronometer talisman hanging above the pages; at that exact tug, a rebellious flame blooms along the wire, and the talisman fractures again, spilling pale “minutes” as translucent moths that flutter into the hall. The nearest portraits recoil as the moths brush their painted faces, changing their expressions mid-syllable. Soft candlelight meets cold dawn haze, tender yet unsettling, with dust glittering like held breath.
