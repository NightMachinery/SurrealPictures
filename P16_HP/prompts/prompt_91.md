Vertical 2:3 composition: In the vaulted entry hall of an old academy, a newly arrived duelist in a severe winter uniform snaps their wrist mid-salute, refusing a formal bow; the gesture whips open a pair of immaculate white gloves whose seams are laced with impossibly fine, dark filaments that glint like living thread. As their fingertips cut the air, the nearest row of gilt photo frames on the wall shudders and begins to trade occupants—faces sliding sideways from frame to frame like cards being dealt—while the duelist tries to hold their ground by driving a small iron anchor charm into the stone floor with their heel. The anchor bites, sending a hairline crack through the tiles, but the cost is immediate: the duelist’s own portrait, freshly hung and still damp-looking, starts to pull them in by the shoulders, blurring their outline as an onlooking rival’s grin replaces it. Dust motes hang in cold lamplight; gray ribbon drapes a plain wooden stool like a muted badge of judgment.
