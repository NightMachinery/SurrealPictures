Vertical 2:3 composition: In a sunken lounge beneath a dark lake-window, a lone archivist leans forward mid-breath, fingers slipping under a dragonhide strap that cinches shut a tall runic filing cabinet; the metal chain is taut, but the buckle is already lifting. At the instant it loosens, wet ink footprints flare into existence on the moonlit floorboards behind her—appearing, vanishing, then reappearing closer, as if someone is hurrying toward her from an impossible distance. The prints race past a ceremony stool draped in a plain gray ribbon, and the ribbon tightens like a held hand. The footprints climb the memorial wall of charred wand-cores, turning into a translucent silhouette that reaches through the scorched relics toward the archivist’s shoulder. Green stormlight pulses through the waterglass, painting everything in soft emerald and bruised shadow as the cabinet door begins to open on its own, exhaling a warm, intimate draft that smells of smoke and longing.
