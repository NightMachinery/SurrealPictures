Vertical 2:3 composition: In the atrium of a newly “kind” government hall, a lone night-caretaker in a neat uniform strides onto a narrow glass bridge that spans two opposing neighborhoods like a treaty stretched thin; mid-step, she holds out a small silver badge while her other hand cracks open a sealed envelope, and the words inside lift off as pale origami birds. The birds spiral upward and, in their negative space, accidentally reveal a second figure—a rival messenger—standing invisibly close, as if cut from the air. Below, miniature office windows glow like a bird’s‑eye diorama of petty departments: competing banners, staged smiles, rehearsed charity. The caretaker’s fearless advance triggers an immediate consequence: the bridge’s panes bloom into warm room-light, turning into the outline of a modest home suspended over the divide, while ink-black shadows creep along the railings like doubt trying to reclaim it. Soft lantern haze, uneasy sweetness, a fragile truce happening now.
