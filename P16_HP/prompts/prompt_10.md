Vertical 2:3 — In a hushed, cathedral-long dining hall built like an arrow, every floorboard seam and ceiling beam lunges toward a single vanishing point behind an empty head chair, where one banquet seat is strangled with interwoven striped scarves like ceremonial vines. In the exact center aisle, a lone, faceless heir crouches mid-motion, flipping open a weathered travel trunk layered with overlapping academy emblems and faded victory stamps; the lid is still rising, and the air seems to inhale with it. Nestled inside, a small glass capsule is being uncorked, and a dark, impossibly fine ribbon unfurls from within, threading itself toward the bound chair as if it recognizes a promise. The instant the ribbon loops the chair’s backrest, shattered tiara pieces on the tablecloth twitch, lift, and begin assembling into a hovering crown—yet its shadow falls onto the heir instead, erasing any hint of identity. The hall remains serenely bright, but every portrait on the walls turns its face away at once.
