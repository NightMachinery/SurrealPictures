A rain-damp corridor of an extravagant private menagerie falls into a held-breath hush as a relentless journalist, half-kneeling, slips gloved fingers under the clasp of their traveling cloak—an ornate fastener shaped like a closed eyelid—and pries it open mid-step, revealing a warm, softly pulsing bundle tucked against the ribs. Beside them, a calm companion in a healer’s coat steadies the journalist’s shoulder while scanning the shadows with tender suspicion, one hand already poised to stanch a wound that hasn’t happened yet. In the bundle, smooth oval “stones” breathe faint heat; each exhale makes nearby vines sprout feathers, and orchids unfurl tiny paws that cling playfully to the journalist’s bootlaces, eager to follow. At the far end, polished trophy masks on the wall subtly turn as if listening, their glass eyes fogging over in delayed recognition. The journalist’s smile is almost guilty—mischief disguised as duty—while lanternlight dims into a velvety pause, as though the whole building is waiting to decide whether to wake.
