In a vertical 2:3 frame, a calm-faced archive apprentice slides on one knee across a chalk-littered corridor, mid‑motion uncorking a small crystal vial stamped with a stern warning seal, letting a single silver drop fall into a rip in the air like a seam being stitched; as the drop touches, the rip briefly closes and a missing student’s laughter echoes back into the hall, but the immediate consequence is cruelly quiet—every portrait along the walls begins to lose its eyes, paint pooling downward into unreadable signatures. In the near clutter: toppled hourglasses, torn debate pamphlets, spilled ink forming tiny constellations around a snapped ribbon of time. In the mid action: two gloved hands from off‑frame reach toward the apprentice’s neck where a shadow‑sun locket hangs split down the middle, tugging it in opposite directions. In the far architecture: a tunnel carved through black stone spirals toward a grand lecture rotunda, lit by a dim, eclipse-like glow that makes dust drift like slow snow, serene and unsettling.
