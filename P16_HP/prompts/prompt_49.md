Vertical 2:3 Dixit-card scene: In a vaulted reading-hall where living tree roots lace through stone arches and shelves bend like branches, a clandestine shapeshifting apprentice is caught mid-change—one hand still human, the other already feathered—while trying to tuck a stolen ribbon of recollection back into a glyph-etched filing cabinet. The cabinet’s doors are chained shut with dark, scaled straps, and the strain snaps a single link: dozens of warm, glassy lantern-memories surge out in a tidy queue that instantly tangles, drifting into one another like colliding dreams. In the apprentice’s other hand, a graduation parchment unfurls, its ink freshly “signed” by framed portraits whose painted mouths lean out to whisper approval and doubt; the signatures spill off the page as liquid gold, pooling into an overflowing tide of gratitude at the apprentice’s boots. In the lantern-glow, the merged memories flicker between a hidden refuge’s cramped hush and sunlit school corridors, casting soft, unsettling double-shadows across the room as the apprentice freezes, realizing the leak is happening now.
