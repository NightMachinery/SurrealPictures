Vertical 2:3 composition: In the deserted rotunda of a once-famous arcane academy—its debate dais repurposed into a silent tribunal—one exhausted student-mender hovers a handspan above the cracked marble, mid-reach as a small glass vial slips from their satchel and floats toward the void; a torn label on it warns, in hurried ink, “DO NOT REWRITE.” Their fingertips almost touch the cork, and a gentle, honey-warm glow spills out anyway, threading through the air like bandage-light. Immediate consequence: the collapsed, coiling staircase behind them begins to knit back together, but it reassembles with wrong memories—balusters forming from lacey upholstery patterns studded with tiny knuckle-bones—while two rival factions in old uniforms appear in overlapping “echo-poses,” as if several seconds of argument were pressed into one frame. On the bench, a discarded folding fan painted with black snakes and moon-pale blossoms flutters by itself, stirring dust into a soft, unsettling snowfall.
