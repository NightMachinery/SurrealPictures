A towering figure kneels inside a winding hall that doubles as a maze and a tribunal, her shoulders brushing hanging banners as if the room were made for smaller lives; she is mid-motion, threading a needle through torn, mismatched cloth to stitch a curtain across an ornate but conspicuously empty family frame. In her other hand she grips a small, dented timepiece frozen at a single minute, its chain dragging a faint trail of soot like an old night’s aftermath. The instant her stitch bites, a clerk’s ledger on the floor shudders open: lines of witnesses’ names begin to erase themselves, each struck through by fresh green ink that crawls like moss, while loose confetti whirls up and hardens into iridescent glass flecks that cut tiny bright stars into the air. Her face holds a blissful, unsettling calm—half rapture, half refusal—as unseen spectators rearrange in the labyrinth’s corridors. Vertical 2:3 composition, soft luminous haze, playful color with ominous undertow.
