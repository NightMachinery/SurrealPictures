Vertical 2:3 composition: In a vaulted government briefing hall turned strangely intimate, a neat spokesperson in a crisp suit—smooth blank mask where a face should be—leans forward mid-motion, pressing a bare palm against a vast wall-hanging whose woven garden is studded with living briars; the thorns pierce their skin, yet instead of blood, a soft amber heat seeps out and runs along the threads like mercy choosing a direction. At the instant the warmth reaches the center knot, the tapestry tightens with an audible sigh and spits out small paper IOUs that flutter upward, each stamped with dates that don’t agree with the clocks, as if apologies have due dates. Above, the ceiling behaves like a night sky under glass, rearranging into star-patterns that no atlas would admit, and those shifting points cast silhouettes of modern students in the back row, mouths open as they overhear a looping, unfinished teenage quarrel from a different year. The air feels tender, wrong, and almost safe—until the briars begin to bloom teeth.
