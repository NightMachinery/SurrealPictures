Vertical 2:3 composition, extreme low-angle view from the scuffed dormitory floor as a monumental, half-repaired building rises like a civic temple around a single student perched on a bedframe, mid-stitch, pulling a strand of copper filament through the cracked rim of a floating pocketwatch that leaks tiny glassy seconds. The student’s other self stands behind a thin curtain—repainted into a makeshift truce banner—silent, palms pressed to the fabric in exact counter-gesture, coordinating without eye contact as if they’ve rehearsed this moment for too many mornings. In the foreground, the perched student drags a thumb through warm black resin and presses a feather into it, sealing over a faint ancestral brand on their wrist; the consequence blooms instantly: the resin threads into feathered tar-vines that climb the banner and sag into a sudden canopy, turning the room into an improvised home. From the canopy’s hem, handwritten “thank you” notes spill like rain, pooling into shimmering puddles that reflect a surname slowly unspelling itself.
