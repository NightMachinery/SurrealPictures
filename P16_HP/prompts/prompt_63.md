Vertical 2:3 composition, steep Dutch angle with cascading diagonals: in the immediate foreground, a pair of black silk–gloved hands, dusted with shimmering silver residue, lifts four goblets in a strained peace toast—amber, jade, cobalt, and milky rose—while the heir’s signet ring (engraved with a heavy family surname) is pressed hard against the rim mid-clink, about to crack it. At the instant of contact, the surname on the ring unthreads into floating letters that become audible-looking ribbons—curled staff lines and tiny bells—whipping across the scene with visible velocity. The sound-ribbons lash toward a distant winged horse in a courtyard below, tightening into tack braided with neat “apology knots,” as if regret is being fastened on in real time. Behind the creature, students in spotless uniforms maintain a public, neutral posture while secretly passing bread, medicine, and sealed notes through a half-open cellar door revealed by the drifting music. Moonlit fog, sharp highlights on glass, uneasy tenderness in everyone’s frozen breath.
