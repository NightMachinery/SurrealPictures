Vertical 2:3 composition: in a salt-misted seaside pavilion set for a twilight supper, one lone caretaker stands mid-action behind a veil of translucent curtains, half-hidden as she tips a small ladle of pearly liquid into a chipped shell-cup at the head of the table; the instant the first drop lands, a tight, ink-dark ribbon of “something remembered” loosens from her sternum and snakes outward across the linen like a living stitch, tugging a vacant place setting forward an inch as if a guest has just taken their seat. The table is meticulously arranged yet haunted by several empty chairs, each with a neatly folded napkin shaped like a different bird that watches the pour. Beyond the open side of the pavilion, smooth pebbles and driftwood glint, and odd, polished door-handles and keys wash in with the tide as though the sea keeps returning exits that no longer fit. Warm lantern light fights the cold dusk, turning the curtains into soft, breathing walls while the caretaker’s face holds calm ritual care and a flicker of fear at the consequence she has triggered.
