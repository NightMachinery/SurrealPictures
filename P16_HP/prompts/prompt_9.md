In a lofty transit atrium where the floor subtly slopes as if the world is tipping, an astral cartographer in spotless travel whites stands mid-gesture atop a wobbling sorting seat, tightening a plain gray ribbon around their own wrist like a vow before it slips away; with the other hand they uncork a tiny crystal flacon and atomize a shimmering, scented mist over a marriage-contract scroll suspended in midair. The mist condenses into living constellations that crawl across the parchment, re-writing names into star-coordinates while nearby emissaries—human, porcelain-pale siren, and sharp-eyed, pocket-sized financier—lean in, spellbound and wary. The immediate consequence hits at once: the atrium’s hanging debris (coins, petals, broken glass, and luggage tags) arrests into a slow, upward river, and a row of anonymous doorways begins to unlock one by one, each exhaling a different season. Soft, milky light, gentle tenderness undercut by cosmic awe; vertical composition, 2:3 aspect ratio.
