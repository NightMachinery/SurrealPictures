Vertical 2:3 — From a hidden vantage behind softly billowing translucent curtains, a lone bureau “comfort officer” in neat gloves is mid-action, pressing a corked medicine jar of warm, molted ember-feathers to a fresh bruise on a living parchment map laid across a desk; the instant the jar tilts, a low humming shimmer leaks out and the map’s inked routes rise into three-dimensional corridors, tunneling through the room’s sugar-plastered walls as if the building itself were edible and yielding. Across the desk, two rival clerks in matching polite uniforms reach at the same time—one to stop the spill, one to claim it—freezing their hands inches apart in a reverent, weaponized silence. The immediate consequence blooms: the newly lifted corridors split open a forgotten passage, and a soot-stained luggage tag with no owner drifts up from the crack, tapping the curtain like a quiet accusation. Lantern light turns the air milky, sweet, and faintly ominous.
