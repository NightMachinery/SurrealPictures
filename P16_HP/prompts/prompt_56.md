Vertical 2:3 composition for a gallery-grade Dixit card: In a midnight government archive where shelves bend like reeds under the weight of labeled memories, a lone case-inspector leans over a guttering candle, mid-scratch of a rough three-mark seal into its warm wax while her other hand twists the lid of a confiscated glass locket that hums with someone else’s childhood laughter. Behind her, a hooded vigilante—too close to be only a suspect—reaches in to swap the locket with a decoy, their fingertips nearly touching, their faces lit with quiet familiarity and a shared, guilty tenderness. The instant the seal completes, the ceiling’s giant cracked time-glass shudders and begins shedding glittering iron grit upward instead of down, peppering the air; each grain bursts into tiny, living lantern-insects that carry fragments of nostalgia, blooming against stamped forms and sharp-edged training duels practiced by stern new recruits with ink-black wands and colder rules.
