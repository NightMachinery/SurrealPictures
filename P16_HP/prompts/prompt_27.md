Vertical 2:3 — In the hush of a municipal occult records office, a serene case clerk pauses mid-action, one hand halfway threading a tiny ivory key (shaped like a miniature skeleton, worn as jewelry) onto a wristlet strung with pale human molars, while the other hand reaches toward a masked street vigilante who is sliding a dented authority pin across the desk like a fragile ceasefire token; the clerk’s expression is deep calm, almost merciful, as if granting a pardon rather than taking evidence. The immediate consequence blooms overhead: the office ceiling splits along its seams and the daytime sky is being unbuttoned and replaced like wallpaper—one corner peeled back to reveal an older, darker firmament beneath—so loose forms and stamped papers lift in a slow upward draft, hovering around filing cabinets and hanging lamps. Dust motes glitter in gentle bluish light; the scene feels playful yet unsettling, as if forgiveness has rewritten the rules of gravity.
