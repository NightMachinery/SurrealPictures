Vertical 2:3 composition: In a half-abandoned diplomatic salon that has been repurposed into a clandestine planning room, a single traveler in evening wear strides forward mid-step, finally lifting a crushing, ornate mantle off their shoulders—its inside lined with tiny gears and hair-thin luminous pathways like a nervous system. With their other hand they raises a toast toward an unseen circle: four tall chalices on a low table catch the light as if each holds a different mood—amber warmth, green calm, violet doubt, pale blue resolve. As the rim of the traveler’s glass touches their lips, the mantle slips free and hits the floor in slow motion, bursting into a swarm of delicate paper-thin moths made from old admission slips and margin-scribbled tactics, fluttering upward to plaster themselves onto the walls like living annotations. A writing instrument tucked behind the traveler’s ear sheds a few prismatic embers that drift like fireflies, illuminating the relieved exhale on their face while the open doorway ahead glows with unsettling, beckoning moonlight.
