Vertical 2:3 Dixit card scene: In a neon-washed, concrete atrium wrapped around a corkscrew staircase, a sleepless night curator stands mid-step, one hand tipping a small glass vial stamped with a stern warning label, the other clutching a tarnished pocket watch whose dial inexplicably jumps from twelve to thirteen; as the silvery contents spill into the air, the atrium’s ceiling ripples like shallow water and resolves into a map of impossible constellations that rearrange themselves around his breath. At that exact moment, the gallery’s wall of ornate photo frames shudders and begins its nightly trick: inside the nearest frame, the curator’s own face slides out of the portrait, eyes wide, while a stranger’s smile slides in to replace it. The immediate consequence is visible and unsettling—his shadow on the stairwell detaches, stepping toward the frame as if answering an exchange contract, while the watch ticks louder and the neon reflections pulse like a heartbeat.
