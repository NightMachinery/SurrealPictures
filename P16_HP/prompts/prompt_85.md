Vertical 2:3 — In a smoke-stained winter garden converted into a midnight celebration, an older sibling in a salt-crusted coat steps forward mid-toast and offers a palm-sized gift to the younger one they haven’t touched in years; the younger sibling’s hands tremble as they loosen the twine, revealing three odd keepsakes (a chipped compass, a sliver of mirror, a pale coin) nested in velvet, and the instant the lid lifts, dozens of thumbprint-bright creatures made of breathy light spring out, ricocheting between hanging glass ornaments and the guests’ upturned faces. As the luminous swarm climbs, it stitches itself into a floating canopy that bends overhead like a protective tent, and the consequence hits at once: every clink, laugh, and footstep is swallowed into an uncanny hush, candles steady, confetti suspended midair. Beneath the silence, a curled parchment banded around sea-lavender unfurls on its own, hovering between the siblings like an unspoken apology, while the garden’s shattered panes show a tranquil sky that feels borrowed from somewhere sacred.
