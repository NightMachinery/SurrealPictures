Vertical 2:3 composition, extreme low-angle view: an adult figure in a loosened uniform coat stands on the steps of a monumental, cathedral-sized schoolhouse that has quietly fused with a clandestine apartment corridor—locker doors become gun safes, chalk dust mingles with perfume. Mid-action, they hold two halves of a heavy seal ring against their lower lip, breathing heat until a thin vein of liquid gold crawls between the fractures; at the same instant they tilt a silver-green locket toward a puddle at their feet, and the puddle answers like a potion, reflecting not the building but a different sky. The immediate consequence ripples outward: scattered pomegranate seeds around the puddle lift and orbit in slow, intimate spirals, while ribbons pinned along the walls—each tied around a sealed envelope—begin to untie themselves and thread upward, tugged toward a vast owl-shaped shadow crossing overhead. The “new” sky slides into place like a stage backdrop, tearing open to a quiet, cosmic depth that turns their expression into awe and dangerous longing.
