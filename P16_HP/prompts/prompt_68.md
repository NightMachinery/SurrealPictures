Vertical 2:3 composition: A poised young records clerk, face serene in an almost unnerving calm, kneels on a freshly mended circular sparring dais and tips a tiny vial over a parchment atlas spread on the boards—mid-pour, the spilled liquid turns yesterday’s brittle wax insignias into glossy new ones that bloom like leaves over half-erased emblems, and the change ripples outward as if the paper were skin. The atlas reacts instantly: dark, animated footmarks scuttle away from her fingertips, rerouting themselves into a new route that spells a warning without letters, and the nearest lanterns around the ring flare brighter in sympathy, casting celebratory light that feels slightly too eager. She watches from behind a veil of translucent drapery hung like theater curtains, one hand parting the fabric, the other clutching a stamped seal still warm. In the background, students in mismatched colors clasp hands in an uneasy toast while the floorboards quietly rearrange their lines of allegiance.
