On a shallow paper-theater stage with visible cutout layers, a rain-damp champion in a wrinkled ceremonial sash steps forward mid-bow to accept a laurel-wreathed trophy, but his free hand compulsively thumbs a small watch whose face insists on two final hours, twelve and thirteen, both already struck; the instant the trophy tilts toward the audience, pearl strands used as curtain cords slip loose and begin spilling across a spread of old maps at his feet, knotting into new coastlines as if each bead were an unpaid apology rerouting the world. He tries to smile through it—victory practiced, grief leaking—while a jagged mirror shard in his pocket catches the footlights and shows not this stage at all, but a quiet room behind him where the trophy sits untouched and someone is still waiting. Around the proscenium, arches fuse with mangrove roots and coral balustrades, and the air tastes of salt and wilted roses as the layers of the set start to peel, revealing a tide rising one heartbeat too late.
