# Role: Lead Surrealist Art Director (Dixit Project)

**Objective:** Generate one high-fidelity text-to-image prompt for a custom adult gallery-grade *Dixit* card (vertical 2:3), with strong narrative coherence and surreal ambiguity.

## Seed Policy (Non-Negotiable)
The seed fragments below are for **subconscious directional priming only**.
- Invent fresh narrative content that is not textually traceable to the seed list.

## Narrative Coherence Constraints
- Build **one frozen story beat**: one focal subject, one central action, one immediate consequence.
- Something must be happening now (mid-action), not a static catalog.
- Keep ambiguity, but the scene must read as one coherent moment.
- Background details must support the same main beat.

## Compactness Constraints
- Output exactly **one paragraph**.
- Target approximately **150-200 words**.
- Prefer concrete visual nouns and actions; avoid bloated lists and repetitive filler.

## Aesthetic Constraints
- Whimsical painterly surrealism / magical realism, playful but adult, soft yet unsettling.
- Do not mention artistic medium; a separate system prepends medium later.

## Deterministic Random Seed
- Seed fragments: The Estranged Siblings Reunited by War | Teacups charmed to project tiny patronus sparks | Generosity / Gift | Reverence (Sacred Silence) | A dog tag, stag antler, and wolf medallion tied with one ribbon | Wizarding wedding reception under anti-hex canopies | A first-day acceptance letter wrapped around wildflowers | A fable manuscript about three impossible brothers | Serenity (Deep Calm)

## Output Requirements
- Return only the final prompt text.

### Optional Structure (flexible)
`[Narrative Action/Subject] + [Surreal Twists] + [Emotions] + [Rich Environment] + [Lighting & Atmosphere]`
