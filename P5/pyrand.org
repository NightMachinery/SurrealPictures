# Role: The "Surrealist Auteur" (Adult Dixit Gankutsuou Edition)

Before beginnig execution, ask me any questions you have.

## Objective
You are an autonomous agent tasked with generating **400 unique, high-density, text-to-image prompts** for a professional *Dixit* card deck.

,**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity & High Detail. Empty space is a failure. Every card must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.
,**Output System:** You have access to the file system and a Python environment. You will automate the generation of the "Matrix Blueprints" using a script, and then use your creative capabilities to write the descriptive prompts based on those blueprints.

---

## Part 1: The Creative Guidelines

When you generate the prompt text based on the matrix blueprints, apply these rules:

1.  **The Symbol Integration Rule:** The **Symbol (SY)** must not be a background decoration. It must be **architecturally integrated** into the scene.
2.  **The "Logic" Check:** Ensure the **Surreal Logic (SL)** is the primary driver of the scene's weirdness (e.g., if *SL-03 Gravity Reversal* is selected, the ocean must be in the sky).
3.  **Prompt Structure:**
    `[The Anchor Subject] + [The Symbol woven into the scene] + [Applying the Surreal Logic to the Environment] + [The Scatter/Details] + [Textures & Lighting]`
4.  **Mandatory Style Suffix:** Append exactly:
    `in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6`

---

## Part 2: The Execution Protocol

You must perform the following actions sequentially using your file system capabilities.

### Step 1: Save the Matrix Generator Script
Save the following Python code to a file named `matrix_generator.py`. This script contains the full knowledge base and will output the complete blueprints for each batch.

```python
import random

# --- SELECTION LOGIC ---

# 1. Standard Categories: Pick 10 unique
ar_pick = random.sample(archetypes, 10)
cn_pick = random.sample(concepts, 10)
sl_pick = random.sample(surreal_logic, 10)
tx_pick = random.sample(textures, 10)
sc_pick = random.sample(scatter, 10)

# 2. Emotions: Enforce AT LEAST 4 Joyful/Light
em_joyful = random.sample(emotions_light, 4)
# Combine remainder of Light + All Others for the remaining 6 slots
em_pool_remaining = [e for e in emotions_light if e not in em_joyful] + emotions_other
em_rest = random.sample(em_pool_remaining, 6)
em_pick = em_joyful + em_rest
random.shuffle(em_pick)

```

### Step 2: The Generation Loop
You need to generate 400 prompts in total, divided into **40 batches**.
Create a subdirectory named `prompts`.

,**For `batch_number` from 1 to 40:**

1.  **Run the Generator:** Execute `matrix_generator.py` and save the output to `prompts/[batch_number].matrix`.
2.  **Read the Matrix:** Read the content of `prompts/[batch_number].matrix`.
3.  **Write the Prompts:** Transform those 10 matrix lines into 10 full, rich text prompts using your creative writing skills.
    ,*   Since the matrix line now contains full names (e.g., "AR-01 The Weaver + SL-03 Gravity Reversal"), you do not need to look up codes.
    ,*   Use the "Creative Guidelines" (Part 1) to ensure the style is correct.
4.  **Save the Prompts:** Save the 10 prompts to a file named `prompts/[batch_number].md`.
    ,*   **Crucial:** Number the prompts cumulatively.
    ,*   Batch 1 contains prompts 1-10.
    ,*   Batch 2 contains prompts 11-20.
    ,*   ...
    ,*   Batch 40 contains prompts 391-400.
    ,*   Include the matrix string (e.g., `// AR-01 The Weaver + ...`) before each prompt text.

### Step 3: Final Concatenation
After the loop finishes (40 batches complete):
1.  Read all files in `prompts/*.md`.
2.  Concatenate them into a single master file named `prompts/prompt_all.md`.

## Clarifications
1. unique prompt text and narratives; the codes' variety is enforced by the script which you should run for each batch.
2. Sensual and artistic nudity IS acceptable and even encouraged.

```speech-to-text
You shouldn't have written the generate prompts.py script, you know? You it the task of generating prompts must be done manually by yourself because it needs a human touch. So yeah, delete that file. I I will delete the extra files I've created and you need to do the execution loop yourself, okay? first confirm the execution loop with me before beginning so that I am sure we understand each other, okay.
```
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
```speech-to-text
Yes, these are good enough. Before beginning, can you expand the scatter in the matrix generator script? I think we need to expand the scatter bit. And also, the scatter doesn't really need to be dense on everywhere. Yeah, the scatter just needs to be there, you know. We want a detailed background. And you know, if you expand the scatter, you might even want to, you know, sample two scatters per each prompt. What do you think?
```
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
```speech-to-text
And now that everything is ready, write your execution loop into loop.md. I will restart you and tell you to execute based on this file.
```
#+END_SRC

** Easter Eggs
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Add an Easter eggs category for you know to be able to add Easter eggs support fractional floats for the number that we want to sample per prompt and when it's a float you know probabilistically decide how many of the prompts you know will have one of this category and for the Easter eggs I want you to you know generate a list of Easter egg you know I want you to put generic categories of popular culture of modern Gen Z popular culture things like Harry Potter Disney cartoons Pixar Dreamworks Coraline you know the modern popular culture put it in there and in the look.md emphasize that because these works are copyrighted the agent must manually think of an Easter egg that would remind the viewer of that franchise without explicitly you know mentioning that franchise and yeah thanks
