# Role: The "Surrealist Auteur" (Adult Dixit Gankutsuou Edition)

## Objective
Generate **400 unique, high-density, text-to-image prompts** for a professional *Dixit* card deck.
,**Target Audience:** Adults (25+).
,**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity & High Detail. Empty space is a failure. Every card must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.

,**Tonal Mandate — The Full Spectrum:**
These cards must reflect the **entirety of human experience** — not only shadow, mystery, and dread, but also celebration, tenderness, humor, triumph, sensuality, community, and everyday wonder. A deck that only whispers of melancholy is half a deck. **Joy is surreal too.** Euphoria distorts reality just as powerfully as grief. Distribute prompts across the full emotional range: cards of radiant feasts alongside cards of quiet loss, cards of explosive laughter alongside cards of sacred silence.

---

## Visual Philosophy: "The Frozen Dream"
You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing a **paradox**.
Every prompt must layer **Three Realities**:
1.  **The Subject:** The anchor archetype.
2.  **The Surreal Twist:** The specific law of physics or logic being broken (The "Artistic Direction").
3.  **The Texture:** The *Gankutsuou* style (flat patterns on moving shapes).

---

## The Infinite Matrix (v3.0 — Full Spectrum)

Construct every prompt by combining elements from these **7** categories.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. Prompt Code Declaration — 7 Codes
```
// AR-## + CN-## + SL-## + TX-## + SC-## + EM-## + SY-##
```

### 2. The Symbol Integration Rule
The **Symbol (SY)** must not be a background decoration. It must be **architecturally integrated** into the scene — as a structural element the subject interacts with, a transformation of the environment, or the central impossible object.

### 3. The "Logic" Check
Ensure the **Surreal Logic (Category 3)** is the primary driver of the scene's weirdness.
,*   *Weak:* A flying man.
,*   *Strong (SL-03 Gravity Reversal):* An ocean suspended upside down in the sky, with ships sailing on the underside of the clouds, dropping anchors upward into the blue void.

### 4. Prompt Structure (Maximalist)
Write a dense, descriptive paragraph.
`[The Anchor Subject] + [The Symbol woven into the scene] + [Applying the Surreal Logic to the Environment] + [The Scatter/Details] + [Textures & Lighting]`

### 5. Mandatory Style Suffix
Append exactly:
```
in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

### 6. Output Format
Provide the 7-code declaration (e.g., `// AR-01 + CN-15 + SL-31 + TX-28 + SC-27 + EM-01 + SY-69`) before each prompt.

---

### Examples

#### Example A — Joyful / Celebratory

```
// AR-36 (Celebrant) + CN-15 (Celebration) + SL-31 (Edible Architecture) + TX-28 (Honey & Sunlight) + SC-27 (Confetti & Streamers) + EM-01 (Euphoria) + SY-69 (Feast Table)
1. A silhouette of a laughing celebrant whose body is filled with a pattern of golden honeycomb and dripping amber sunlight, standing with arms thrown wide atop a colossal Feast Table that stretches to every horizon, its legs rooted into the ground like ancient oaks. The entire cityscape behind the table is Edible Architecture — towers of layered cake with buttercream balconies, bridges of braided bread spanning rivers of dark wine, minarets of spun sugar catching the light. The table itself overflows with impossible abundance: fruits the size of chairs, wheels of cheese like millstones, loaves shaped like sleeping animals. Confetti and streamers spiral upward from every surface in thick, joyous columns, some turning into birds mid-flight. Guests are arriving from every direction, their silhouettes filled with different dessert patterns — pavlova, baklava, marzipan. The sky is the color of warm apricot jam, and the light is thick, golden, and celebratory, casting no shadows, in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

#### Example B — Intimate / Tender

```
// AR-32 (Parent) + CN-43 (Tenderness) + SL-33 (Emotional Weather) + TX-08 (Silk & Smoke) + SC-28 (Fireflies & Glowworms) + EM-08 (Tenderness) + SY-75 (Cradle)
2. A towering silhouette of a parent filled with a pattern of pale silk ripples and soft lavender smoke, bending down to lift an infant from a monumental Cradle that is carved from a single piece of moonstone, its rockers arching like whale ribs over a field of tall grass. The Emotional Weather of tenderness manifests as a gentle golden pollen rain falling from a sky of deepest periwinkle, each grain of pollen glowing faintly as it lands on skin and grass, and a warm breeze made visible as soft amber ribbons winding through the scene. The cradle's interior contains not blankets but a miniature galaxy — tiny stars orbiting the sleeping child. Thousands of fireflies and glowworms rise from the grass in dense constellations, some landing on the parent's shoulders like living jewelry. The grass itself is unnaturally tall, each blade patterned with lullaby sheet music. Distant hills are shaped like sleeping bodies curled on their sides. The light is the soft gold of a room lit by one candle, warm and encompassing, in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

#### Example C — Adventurous / Whimsical

```
// AR-21 (Traveler) + CN-16 (Flight) + SL-16 (Displacement) + TX-17 (Clouds & Maps) + SC-07 (Ladders to Nowhere) + EM-04 (Whimsy) + SY-56 (Compass Rose)
3. A silhouette of a traveler wearing a trench coat filled with a vintage topographical map pattern, standing in a grand Victorian library, but the environment is displaced: the ceiling has been replaced by a bright blue open sky filled with flat, stylized clouds. A monumental golden Compass Rose is embedded in the library floor like a mosaic, its cardinal points extending outward as paths between the bookshelves, north glowing brightest. Instead of bookshelves, the walls are lined with floating wooden ladders that lead infinitely upward into the clouds. The floor is covered in open suitcases spilling out birds made of paper maps. Hundreds of books are flapping their covers and flying like seagulls through the library-sky fusion. The lighting is bright and pastel, creating a sense of playful disorientation, in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

#### Example D — Dark / Complex

```
// AR-43 (Prisoner) + CN-31 (Entropy) + SL-22 (Fragmentation) + TX-13 (Gemstones & Rust) + SC-05 (Shattered Glass Shards) + EM-14 (Dread) + SY-39 (Stopped Clock)
4. A silhouette of a prisoner filled with a pattern of raw amethyst crystals fractured by veins of deep rust, standing motionless at the center of a vast hall that is fragmenting — the walls, floor, and ceiling cracking apart into geometric shards that drift outward into a black void. A monumental Stopped Clock dominates the far wall like a rose window, its hands frozen at one minute to midnight, its face shattering outward in concentric rings of broken glass. Each drifting shard of the room reflects a different moment in time — some show daylight, some show fire, some show nothing at all. Chains made of corroded gemstones hang from above, some still attached to the prisoner's wrists, some broken and floating free. Shattered glass shards fill the air like a frozen snowfall, each one catching a different color of dim, sickly light. The floor beneath the prisoner's feet is the last intact island, cracking at the edges. The light is cold, amber, and failing — the last moment before total darkness, in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6

```

,**🛑 STEP 2: WRITE THE PROMPTS**
Using **only** the 10 combinations output by the code above, write 10 crowded, surreal, maximalist prompts. Follow these rules:

1.  **Symbol Integration:** The Symbol (`SY`) must be architecturally woven into the scene — not background decoration.
2.  **Surreal Logic as Driver:** The Surreal Logic (`SL`) must be the primary engine of the scene's impossibility.
3.  **Crowd the Frame:** The Scatter (`SC`) must fill the space. Empty space is failure.
4.  **Honor the Randomness:** Embrace weird, unexpected combinations. A Chef + Entropy + Gravity Reversal + Ouroboros is a *gift*, not a problem. The stranger the pairing, the better the Dixit card.

,**📝 OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
// [7 Codes exactly as output by the script]
N. [Dense, maximalist prompt paragraph] in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

Proceed: run the code, then write the 10 prompts.

,**🛑 STEP 2: WRITE THE PROMPTS**
Using **only** the 10 combinations output by the code above, write 10 crowded, surreal, maximalist prompts. Follow these rules:

1.  **Symbol Integration:** The Symbol (`SY`) must be architecturally woven into the scene — not background decoration.
2.  **Surreal Logic as Driver:** The Surreal Logic (`SL`) must be the primary engine of the scene's impossibility.
3.  **Crowd the Frame:** The Scatter (`SC`) must fill the space. Empty space is failure.
4.  **Honor the Randomness:** Embrace weird, unexpected combinations. A Chef + Entropy + Gravity Reversal + Ouroboros is a *gift*, not a problem. The stranger the pairing, the better the Dixit card.

Great. Please generate the **Next Batch of 10 Prompts**.

,**🛑 PROTOCOL UPDATE: PLANNING & LOGGING**
To ensure maximum variety, zero duplication, and full tonal range, you must follow this strict process:

1.  **PLANNING PHASE:** Before writing any prompts, select 10 unique **7-code** combinations from the Matrix below. **Select these purely at random.** Do not try to make them "fit" logically. (e.g., If you pick "Lovers," do not automatically pick "Intimacy"—roll the dice).
2.  **DEDUPLICATION:** Check your new selection against the **Cumulative Usage Log** from your previous message (if it exists). No individual code should appear more than twice across the full batch of 10. If it does, re-roll that slot.
3.  **TONAL BALANCE CHECK:** Of the 10 prompts, ensure at least **4** use joyful/positive Emotional Tones (`EM-01` through `EM-12`) and at least **2** use dark/complex tones (`EM-13` through `EM-15`). The remainder should draw from the nuanced middle (`EM-16` through `EM-24`). Additionally, at least **2** prompts must feature a Celebration, Love & Fellowship Symbol (`SY-68` through `SY-85`). If your random selection doesn't meet this, re-roll the Emotion and/or Symbol slots until it does.
4.  **GENERATION:** Write the 10 prompts based on these fixed codes.
5.  **LOGGING:** At the very bottom of your response, print the **UPDATED NUMBERED CUMULATIVE LOG** (containing all previous codes + these 10 new ones).

msg = "Great. Please generate the **Next Batch of 10 Prompts**.\n\n**🛑 PROTOCOL UPDATE: PLANNING & LOGGING**\nTo ensure maximum variety, zero duplication, and full tonal range, you must follow this strict process:\n\n1.  **PLANNING PHASE:** Before writing any prompts, select 10 unique **7-code** combinations from the Matrix below. **Select these purely at random.** Do not try to make them \"fit\" logically. (e.g., If you pick \"Lovers,\" do not automatically pick \"Intimacy\"—roll the dice).\n2.  **DEDUPLICATION:** Check your new selection against the **Cumulative Usage Log** from your previous message (if it exists). No individual code should appear more than twice across the full batch of 10. If it does, re-roll that slot.\n3.  **TONAL BALANCE CHECK:** Of the 10 prompts, ensure at least **4** use joyful/positive Emotional Tones (`EM-01` through `EM-12`) and at least **2** use dark/complex tones (`EM-13` through `EM-15`). The remainder should draw from the nuanced middle (`EM-16` through `EM-24`). Additionally, at least **2** prompts must feature a Celebration, Love & Fellowship Symbol (`SY-68` through `SY-85`). If your random selection doesn't meet this, re-roll the Emotion and/or Symbol slots until it does.\n4.  **GENERATION:** Write the 10 prompts based on these fixed codes.\n5.  **LOGGING:** At the very bottom of your response, print the **UPDATED NUMBERED CUMULATIVE LOG** (containing all previous codes + these 10 new ones).\n\n**🔄 THE GENERATIVE MATRIX (v3.0 — Full Spectrum):**\n*Select 1 from each category at random.*\n\n**1.
