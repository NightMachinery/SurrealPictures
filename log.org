#+TITLE: SurrealPictures/log

* P12
Even simplification wasn't that useful. The produced pictures are still rather cliche and formulaic.

P2, without any matrix, might be better.

Perhaps we should change the template. Use the matrix to give the model "seeds" but allow it complete creative freedom to write its own prompt.

It's possible simplifying the expansion prompt will also help. By telling the model write a scene with multiple narratives, we are getting chaotic scenes with no narrative at all.

We should take care not to have any concrete examples in the expansion prompt, as it seems the biasing effect is too much. E.g.,

#+begin_quote
**Conflicting Clues:** Place objects together that tell different stories (e.g., a cage that functions as a sanctuary, or a gift that acts as a heavy burden).
#+end_quote

This might be the reason we are seeing so many cages in the outputs.

* P6-8
The old matrix (P3) that set the main focus was a good thing and we might need it back. We need to make it better though.

### Category 2 — Subject Focus *(The Actor)* [7 options]

| Code | Subject | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `SU-AN` | **The Animal** | A non-human creature is the central actor. Favor unusual species (axolotl, moth, octopus, pangolin, hyena, corvid, deep-sea fish) over defaults (cat, dog, horse). |
| `SU-OB` | **The Object** | An inanimate object is the protagonist — behaving as if alive, enshrined, or transformed. |
| `SU-EN` | **The Environment** | The landscape or architecture *is* the character. There is **no** central figure; the space itself tells the story. |
| `SU-HU` | **The Humanoid** | A person, mythological figure, or ambiguous silhouette is *part of* the scene — active within it, never merely observing. |
| `SU-PA` | **The Pair / Duality** | Two figures or things exist in relationship — confrontation, embrace, orbit, mirror, tug-of-war, almost-touching. The *tension between them* is the subject. |
| `SU-SW` | **The Crowd / Swarm** | Many small things forming a larger pattern, migration, ritual, or emergent shape. No single protagonist — the collective *is* the actor. |
| `SU-BO` | **The Body / Fragment** | An isolated body part — a hand, an eye, a ribcage, a spine, a mouth — is the central subject, rendered at symbolic scale. The rest of the body is absent, implied, or dissolved. |
