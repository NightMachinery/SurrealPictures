# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Vertical 2:3 card illustration, packed frame, flattened collage space with stacked planes and thick ornamental borders made of repeating porcelain leaves and halo motifs; in a dense petrified grove (stone trunks, bark like carved marble) every branch is heavy with glossy porcelain leaves patterned like blue-and-white plates, some chipped, some pristine, crowding the foreground and background with no open sky. Center foreground: The Ferryman stands ankle-deep in a narrow river that runs through the grove like a strip of black glass; his boat is a shallow skiff shaped like an oversized gift box with a ribbon turned into a mooring rope, half-coffin half-present, carrying small white parcels that look weightless but bow the boat’s sides. He rows with an oar whose handle is a polished brass halo (a perfect ring) that slips between his fingers like a shackle and a blessing at once; his face is calm but watchful, eyes fixed on a passenger who might not be there. Beside him on the boat’s prow: The Fool—barefoot, grinning, dressed in immaculate white motley with tiny bell stitches and pockets full of stolen trinkets—leans outward with gleeful trouble, offering the Ferryman a spotless porcelain leaf like a communion wafer while his other hand hides a slingshot made from rosary beads; a small lamb-shaped lantern hangs from his belt, glowing too cleanly for the grove. Midground: a lighthouse rises impossibly from within a petrified tree trunk, its striped tower fused to stone wood; its rotating lantern emits a solid beam that behaves like a ribboned corridor, bending through branches and looping around the halo-oar, tying knots in midair. CRUCIAL broken logic: wherever the lighthouse beam touches—porcelain leaves, water, the Ferryman’s cloak, the Fool’s sleeves—each surface becomes a projector that extrudes physical “memories” outward: miniature rooms, childhood beds, courtroom benches, wedding tables, hospital curtains, birthday cakes, empty cribs, all popping out as tangible dioramas that float on invisible shelves; some memories are bright and immaculate, others cracked like glazed ceramic, and they collide gently like drifting boats, casting shadows that show different scenes than the objects themselves. The Ferryman’s shadow on the water is not his shape but a younger version of the Fool waving goodbye; the Fool’s shadow is a solemn ferryman counting coins; their silhouettes overlap into a third figure that neither is. Background: a sanctuary-cage hangs from branches—an ornate birdcage lined with pillows and a tiny open door—holding a key on a ribbon and a sleeping dove with ink-stained wings; nearby, a paper crown floats above a stone altar as if held by invisible hands. Foreground corners: soap bubbles filled with tiny mapped coastlines rise from the river and burst into confetti-like porcelain shards; a trail of white feathers leads to a sealed jar labeled only with a blank tag; coins scatter like lily pads, each stamped with an eye. The entire scene is crowded with repeating patterns (leaf filigree, lighthouse stripes, halo circles) that overlay the figures, partially obscuring faces and turning the grove into a decorative maze while the Ferryman and the Fool negotiate—one guiding, one tempting—amid solid, looping projections of other people’s pasts.
