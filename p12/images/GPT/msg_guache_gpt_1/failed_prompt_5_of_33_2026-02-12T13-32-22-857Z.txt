Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Extreme low-angle vertical (2:3) view from the velvet-carpeted floor of an interdimensional ferry terminal: monumental, cathedral-sized corridors of deep crimson velvet rise like folded drapery-canyons, their seams stitched into archways, gates, and ticket windows; the architecture feels alive—some corridors yawn open like throats, others pinch shut like eyelids—crowded with layered platforms, dangling signage in unknown alphabets, drifting luggage, and overlapping queues of travelers whose bodies are visibly fragmented into hovering sections (hands, faces, coat hems, shoes) held apart by thin threads of light and trailing roots.  Center foreground, dominating the frame: **the Ferryman** stands on a dock that resembles a ribcage bridge, boots planted wide, cloak heavy and damp as if from another river; he grips an oar carved like a spine, its blade a pale fin sprouting soft moss and tiny feathers. His free hand is extended downward toward the viewer and toward **the Romantist**, a poised figure leaning in close, half-kneeling, eyes fixed on the Ferryman with pleading devotion and wary calculation; the Romantist’s chest is wrapped with a ribboned gift-box harness that looks both like a present and a restraint, heavy enough to bend posture, yet lovingly tied. Between them, their hands almost meet—tender fingertips hovering—while a faint glow pulses at the gap like a small lantern-heart.  A **breadcrumb trail** runs through the entire scene as a physical path: warm, golden crumbs scattered in deliberate constellations across the velvet floor, up the dock’s rib bones, and into the air; some crumbs float like fireflies, others are stamped into the carpet by many passing feet. The crumbs lead simultaneously toward and away from a **skull**: a real human skull used as a ticket booth lantern near the Ferryman’s hip, its eye sockets fitted with glass turnstiles, its jaw propped open to dispense paper tickets; the skull’s teeth are dusted with crumbs, and a thin stream of crumbs spills from its mouth like an hourglass.  Hunger/desire is everywhere in tangible mechanisms: ticket gates shaped like soft jaws click shut and reopen; velvet walls press forward with lip-like folds that sip at the floating crumbs; suitcases gape to reveal empty plates and polished cutlery; a vending machine offers only mirrors; a long bench is covered in napkins embroidered with bite marks. The Ferryman’s ferry—moored behind them, towering upward—has a hull made of overlapping petals and fish scales, fragmented into sections that don’t touch, each gap bridged by vines; koi-fins bloom into orchids, and orchids twitch like gills. Above the dock, airborne fauna-flora hybrids drift through the terminal’s upper vaults: moths with rose petals for wings, sparrows with fern fronds for tails, tiny deer-antlers sprouting from bouquets that flutter and nibble crumbs mid-flight.  Conflicting clues crowd every corner: a birdcage hangs open like a sanctuary, lined with soft velvet and baby teeth; a wedding veil doubles as a fishing net, snagging petals and boarding passes; a bouquet in the Romantist’s arms is also a small, hungry creature—tulip mouths gently closing around crumbs—yet it nuzzles the Romantist’s wrist with careful affection. In the shadows under the monumental arches, fragmented passengers barter: someone offers a single crumb on a silver spoon; someone hides a skull-shaped locket; someone cradles an empty bowl like a newborn. Soft, warm light—amber and rose—pours from hidden corridor seams and from the skull-lantern, wrapping the Ferryman and Romantist in a palpable tenderness even as the terminal’s velvet architecture slowly leans inward, as if deciding whether to swallow them or give them passage.
