# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Vertical 2:3 frame, centered one-point perspective down a long bathhouse nave; aggressive depth lines from black-and-white porcelain tiles and repeating archways converge to a single vanishing point at a distant round doorway. Gravity is reversed in a hard split: the left half of the corridor obeys “down” toward the tiled floor, while the right half obeys “down” toward the tiled ceiling; rose steam pours in both directions like twin rivers, and loose objects fall upward on one side and downward on the other. In the exact center on the seam stands The Traveler—barefoot, wet-haired, wrapped in a half-loosened robe that drags in two directions at once—holding an open leather suitcase that is mysteriously weightless: heavy stones, a brass compass, letters sealed with wax, and a folded map float out like sighs. Opposite them, pressed close on the seam as if bargaining for gravity itself, is The Beast—tall, furred, and deliberate, with humanlike eyes and hands; its posture mixes protectiveness and hunger, one hand offering a rose-petal garland like a collar, the other gripping a chain that is also a necklace. Between their faces hangs a slow-turning droplet of bathwater, suspended like a heartbeat; their breaths fog it from both sides. Above the vanishing point, an eclipse is physically present: a black disc occluding a pale lamp-sun in the ceiling oculus, casting a ring of light that behaves like a halo and a warning sign; the ring-light spills onto damp skin, making shadows look relieved, not harsh. In the immediate foreground, a porcelain cradle sits on the central seam, half on floor and half on ceiling, rocking despite having no visible support; inside it lies neither infant nor blanket but a pile of small, intimate burdens—keys, a wedding band, a razor, a bitten pomegranate, a perfume bottle labeled only with a number—each item alternately cradled and trapped as the cradle rocks. Leaning against the cradle is a tall magic mirror with a tarnished silver frame; its surface reflects the corridor correctly on one side and inverted on the other, and in the reflection the Traveler’s robe is tied tight while in “reality” it slips loose, suggesting two incompatible choices at once; the Beast’s reflection shows a muzzle softened like a smile while its real mouth is tense, as if jealous of its own gentleness. The bathhouse is crowded and consuming: attendants in towels carry basins that pour water upward into ceiling-pools; patrons sit calmly on benches bolted to both floor and ceiling, watching with relief as their soap bars and coins drift away; a musician clings to a column with one hand while a stringed instrument floats beside them, bowing itself; a pair of lovers on the ceiling-side press palms to a pair of strangers on the floor-side through a thin sheet of steam, making a single shared silhouette. Porcelain murals cover every wall: tiled scenes of voyages, hunts, births, and funerals repeat in loops, but cracks in the glaze rearrange faces into new stories; some tiles show the Traveler leading the Beast on a leash, others show the Beast carrying the Traveler like a rescued child. Scattered through the corridor are sanctuary-cages: open birdcages lined with warm towels where exhausted birds sleep freely, and locked cages filled only with rose petals that spill out through the bars. At the vanishing point, the round doorway is ajar; from it pours brighter steam and a sense of weight lifting—piles of wet laundry rise like balloons on the ceiling-gravity side while stones gently drift off the Traveler’s suitcase on the floor-gravity side—yet the Traveler and the Beast remain on the seam, negotiating with touch: the Traveler’s fingers rest on the Beast’s wrist where pulse is visible under fur, while the Beast steadies the rocking cradle with unexpected care, as if deciding whether to guard, claim, or release.
