# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Vertical 2:3 composition, viewpoint from the bow of a narrow gondola sliding through flooded market streets packed tight with stalls, hanging signs, tangled ropes, drifting petals, floating fruit, loose coins, half-submerged mannequins, and crowds of masked shoppers pressed shoulder-to-shoulder under striped awnings; in the center foreground stand the two protagonists on adjacent gondolas that are almost touching yet separated by a thin, impossible gap of air: **the Trickster** (lean, jester-silhouetted, foxlike grin, sleeves full of contraband, fingers mid-sleight-of-hand) is tugging a bright thread tied to a **masquerade mask** that floats just out of reach, while **the Vizier** (tall, robed, jeweled turban, calm eyes, heavy ledger and seal rings) extends a bandaged hand offering a small glass vial and a stitched pouch of herbs as if negotiating a cure; between them, a long **feast table** has been displaced upright like a door standing on the water, crowded with bread, pomegranates, oysters, candles, and empty plates—yet the food refuses gravity: wine pours upward into the air, steam sinks into the flood, cutlery swims like fish, and a whole roasted bird drifts away intact, trailing a ribbon of medical gauze; the flooded street itself is broken by displacement: shopfronts and balconies are embedded sideways in the sky above the canal, hanging upside down with dangling lanterns that drip light into the water, while below the surface you can clearly see a second “street” where pedestrians walk on the canal floor, calmly browsing submerged stalls and passing letters sealed with wax; the Trickster’s shadow is displaced onto the Vizier’s robe, mimicking his gestures, while the Vizier’s shadow stands several meters behind on a distant wall, reaching forward as if homesick; around them, recovery is everywhere but ambiguous: cracked ceramic masks on vendor hooks are neatly stitched with gold wire, torn maps are mended with translucent tape like healed skin, a small cage hangs open and padded like a nursery, a bouquet is wrapped in bandages like a wound, and a bouquet of syringes is arranged like flowers beside a child’s lost shoe; mid-background, a bridge is missing its center span, replaced by a taut clothesline of drying bandages and prayer flags stretching into mist, with two separated hands on opposite ends holding the same fraying thread; far background is dense with canal turns, stacked windows, fluttering curtains, and a distant bell tower half-displaced into the waterline, its bells ringing bubbles upward; lighting is late dusk with cold blue floodlight haze and warm amber lantern pools, everything crowded to the edges, secrets tucked in shadows (a ring in an oyster, a key inside a pomegranate, a folded diagnosis under a plate), as the Trickster and the Vizier lock eyes over the upright feast-table “door,” each choosing whether the mask becomes a refuge or a ransom.
