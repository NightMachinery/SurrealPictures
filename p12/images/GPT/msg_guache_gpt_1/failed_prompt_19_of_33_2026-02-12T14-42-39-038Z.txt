# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Vertical 2:3, low-angle view of a crowded nocturnal celebration staged in a half-ruined ballroom that opens into a forest clearing; at the exact center sits a colossal stone **open hand** rising from the floor like an altar, palm up, and standing on its palm is the protagonist: an anthropomorphic **Mirror**—a tall oval mirror with an ornate frame like a ribcage, jointed brass arms and legs, a hinge at its “neck,” and a reflective surface that behaves like a face (pupil-like glints, tears made of condensation); the Mirror actively chooses what to show by tilting itself away from some guests and toward others, one hand shielding part of its own surface while the other hand offers a loop of ribbon like a promise. From this hand-and-mirror core, a strict **radial explosion** of objects and actions fans outward in every direction: streamers stretch like spokes, reflected light shards arc like blades, garlands pull taut like nerves, and every party object is overtly personified—balloons with smiling mouths inhale and exhale to sing, champagne flutes sprout tiny feet and clink their rims like kisses, wrapped gifts dance in a ring while their bows tug like leashes, confetti flutters like a flock of paper birds that land and preen, a metronome in a party hat conducts the noise with angry precision, and a cake crawls forward on icing “fingers” to present its candles like pleading hands. On one dominant radial axis behind the Mirror stands the **lightning-struck tree**, split down the middle and charred, with a frozen bolt still embedded in the trunk like a spear; yet it is dressed for festivity—strings of lanterns hang from burned branches, thank-you cards are pinned like leaves, bandages wrap the bark, and sap beads glow like amber tears that drip into waiting cups. The color of light is physically present as warm amber lantern-glow and soft gold reflections that pool on surfaces, as if gratitude itself is a liquid illumination spilling outward from the Mirror and the open hand; at the same time, fine gray ash mixes with the confetti and collects in corners like unwanted snow. Foreground (largest, closest): a tipped tray of empty plates that crawl back into a neat stack on their own, a bouquet of wilted flowers holding a fresh ribbon, a birdcage with a wide “smiling” door that protects a tiny sleeping bird while its open lock gnaws on the bars, a heavy medal and a wedding ring tied together with twine, a receipt folded into a paper crane, and a glass jar labeled only by a wax seal that contains a small beating paper heart; all these foreground items point inward toward the palm. Midground: guests made of objects crowd the spokes—an accordion bows repeatedly as if apologizing, a mask on a stick hides behind a curtain but its shadow reveals a second face, a stack of invitations and condolence cards shakes hands with each other, a trophy wipes dust from itself and offers the dust like spice, and a bundle of keys forms a chorus line while one key breaks away toward the Mirror’s feet. Background and sky: floating lanterns drift in a circular halo, but interspersed among them are small hovering mirrors with legs peeking out, peering inward like rival witnesses; the ceiling is fractured, and through the opening, fireworks bloom as clusters of tiny thanking hands that dissolve into glittering rain, while far back an empty chair wears a sash and casts a long shadow shaped like a person standing. Occlusion and partitions everywhere: ribbons cross in front of faces, reflections overlap bodies, the Mirror’s surface contains contradictory mini-scenes (a feast table, a courtroom bench, a nursery mobile, a farewell bouquet) that can’t all be true at once; the overall frame is packed edge-to-edge, every object angled as a radial pointer back to the open hand, the Mirror poised in tense gratitude—offering, guarding, and deciding.
