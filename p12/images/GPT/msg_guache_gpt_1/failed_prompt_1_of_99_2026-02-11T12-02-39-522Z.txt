# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Vertical 2:3 frame, low angle viewpoint peering through heavy foreground occlusion: torn translucent veils, thick green coral-vines, and ornate brass railings that cut across the image like bars; droplets cling to the veils like tiny lenses showing distorted faces. Inside a cathedral fortress of coral and brass so crowded it feels alive—packed balconies, spiral staircases, choir lofts, reliquary niches, cannons, bells, pipes, and alcoves—every “hard” surface behaves as soft sculpture: coral columns sag like wax, brass armor folds like cloth, spires slump into plush knots, hinges bend like rubber, and the floor ripples underfoot as if upholstered. Center stage on a rippling balcony, two protagonists collide in intent: **The Friend** (a weary, attentive figure with open hands, pockets spilling small offerings—keys, rings, bandages, bread—eyes fixed on the other with stubborn care) grips the wrist of **The Avatar** (a poised figure with a smooth, mask-like face that reflects whoever looks at it; their body is stitched from mismatched community tokens—name tags, prayer beads, metro cards, hospital bracelets, party wristbands—held together with bright thread). Between them they struggle over the **Philosopher’s Stone**: a palm-sized, heavy-looking stone that paradoxically droops like clay while glowing from within; wherever its glow touches, brass briefly blossoms into coral polyps and coral hardens into polished metal, making the balcony alternately bloom and bruise. Behind them towers the **Sunrise Gate** set into the cathedral’s apse: an immense arch of interlocking “sun rays” that open like a mouth; through it burns a physical sunrise that spills thick bands of gold, magenta, and orange light into the nave, igniting swarms of luminous plankton and petals that whirl like confetti—and the light casts contradictory shadows that look like cheering crowds from one angle and grasping hands from another. Around the protagonists, a dense community presses in: coral monks with bell-throats, brass automatons with soft, dented faces, divers in frayed uniforms, children in oversized helmets, elders on wheeled thrones of knotted kelp—some extend welcoming garlands that tighten into restraints, others hold a velvet-lined cage that is clearly a sanctuary (blankets inside, warm glow) yet its door swings shut by itself; a ceremonial gift-wagon piled high with ribbons and food slumps under impossible weight, crushing its own wheels. High above in the vaulted ceiling, soft brass chandeliers droop into the crowd like reaching arms; in the shadows of side chapels, hidden murals form and un-form from living coral—wedding scenes that resemble funerals, feasts that resemble trials, a map that resembles a scar—while tiny figures behind railings barter masks, exchange names, and tie loose threads to the Avatar’s body. The Friend leans backward, bracing feet on the rippling floor as if trying to keep the Avatar from stepping through the Sunrise Gate; the Avatar leans forward, one foot already sinking into the Gate’s light as if it were warm fabric, turning their stitched tokens into molten-soft ribbons; everywhere, vines and veils either cradle or choke, and the entire cathedral seems to be simultaneously birthing them into the crowd and swallowing them into its soft, crowded body.
