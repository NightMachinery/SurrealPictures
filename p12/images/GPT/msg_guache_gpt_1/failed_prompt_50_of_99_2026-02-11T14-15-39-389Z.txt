# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
Vertical 2:3 card, a single frame designed like a fused diptych: the image is split by a thin seam of mosaic border and stacked poster-like planes, yet the two halves share one continuous masquerade plaza; at the center, a tall falcon (mythic scale, intelligent eyes, talons poised like a judge’s hands) stands on a pedestal that is also a coiled lighthouse staircase, while a human dancer faces it at arm’s length, barefoot on a stage of tessellated tiles; the dancer’s posture is devotional and defiant at once—one hand offers a porcelain masquerade mask like a vow, the other clutches a red cloak that trails behind like both a royal mantle and a warning flag; the falcon leans forward as if negotiating, one wing partially unfurled to shelter, the other wing edged like a blade, feathers turning into ribbon-strips that spiral toward the dancer’s wrists; metamorphosis is everywhere: the dancer’s shadow on the tiles is not human but a falcon in mid-flight, while the falcon’s shadow is a dancer mid-pirouette; the plaza itself is transforming—stone balustrades soften and sag into smooth flowing “liquid” marble that pours upward in impossible arcs, forming frozen ripples that still swirl, and solid puddles of glassy water hold reflections that drift away from their owners; a lighthouse rises in the background but its beam is a rigid column of “light-liquid,” thick as honey yet hard as crystal, bending at right angles through the crowd and pinning masks to faces like halos or muzzles; living chandeliers hang low over everything—chandeliers made of pale fleshy branches and candle-wicks that breathe, with tiny blinking eyes where prisms should be, dripping solid droplets that suspend midair like rosary beads; the masquerade crowd packs the frame: masked figures kneel as if at a ceremony on one side of the seam while on the other side they clap as if at a performance, their hands leaving behind rigid trails of “sound” like carved smoke; in the foreground, an open birdcage sits like a sanctuary—lined with velvet, warmed by a tiny candle—yet its door is chained to the dancer’s ankle with a delicate ribbon; nearby, a gift box wrapped in red cloth is strapped to a statue’s back like a burden, leaking a slow solid stream of glittering liquid-stone that climbs the statue’s spine; the red cloak is caught between two meanings: part of it wraps the falcon’s shoulders like a vestment, part of it pools at the dancer’s feet like a spill, and its hem is embroidered with tiny lighthouses and tiny masks, some upside down; the masquerade mask being offered is cracked down the center, and through the crack a small fledgling beak protrudes as if something inside is hatching; hidden in shadows under the crowd’s feet, the plaza tiles lift like scales, revealing a second face in the architecture—an enormous stone mask mouth half-open as if the plaza is birthing the scene; sacred silence is tangible: incense smoke forms stiff, unmoving ribbons, candles burn without flicker, and every figure’s breath appears as a thin glass thread; camera slightly above eye level, close enough that the falcon and dancer dominate, yet the entire frame is crowded with symbolic debris, floating solid droplets, suspended masks, and the lighthouse’s crystal beam stitching both halves into one uneasy, reverent bargain.
