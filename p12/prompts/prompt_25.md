Vertical 2:3 frame, telephoto-compressed view from shoulder-height on a rain-slick dock in a monsoon harbor so crowded that planes stack into a single dense wall of lacquered pagoda ships, canopies, lantern lines, prayer flags, ropes, and dripping silk sails; in the crushed foreground a colossal humanlike figure (“the Colossus”) kneels between ships like a living breakwater, shoulders wedged under mast forests, hands hovering in a hesitant choice: one palm shielding tiny dockworkers huddled inside a birdcage that is lined with quilts and steaming bowls, the other palm holding a gift-wrapped crate whose ribbon is also a shackle around their wrist; the Colossus wears an enormous cracked ceremonial mask pushed half off their face, revealing another smaller mask beneath, while dozens of different masks hang from rigging like fish, some used as rain gutters, some as bowls catching coins, some as lifeboats, some as blindfolds; a bright hearth fire burns impossibly in the Colossus’s ribcage like an open stove door, casting warm amber light that turns the rain into glowing beads, and the Colossus tips their torso forward as if offering that heat in gratitude—hands full of lit incense sticks, strings of thank-you notes, and overflowing cups that never spill despite the wind; the broken-physics centerpiece: every raindrop in the air is a floating lens projecting crisp, miniature memories as tangible dioramas—childhood rooms, wedding tables, hospital corridors, battlefield trenches, empty cradles, crowded feasts—each memory scene spilling out of the droplet as paper-thin architecture that overlaps the ships, drapes over masts, and wraps around people’s ankles, while the Colossus’s fingertips “edit” these projections by sliding a droplet like a lantern, changing which past becomes solid in the present; coiled through the midground rigging is a massive basilisk integrated into the harbor itself—its scaled body is lacquered like the ships, its spine forms a bridge of carved dragon-ornament, and its eyes are polished mirrors that reflect different faces depending on angle: a protector’s gaze on one side, a predator’s stare on the other; wherever the basilisk’s reflected eyes fall, masks turn toward the viewer and harden into real faces, while other faces soften into blank mask-wood, creating contradictory clues of confession and deception; in the compressed background, pagoda ships press together like a crowded city, some masts topped with family portraits instead of flags, some with courtroom gavels, some with baby toys, some with funeral wreaths, all jostling under sheets of rain; above, low storm clouds are stitched with floating lanterns that contain tiny hands applauding, and between them drift folded paper boats carrying keys, teeth, and wedding rings; in the shadows under the dock, half-submerged statues of past versions of the Colossus reach up as if asking to be rescued, while the present Colossus looks down with a bowed head and a hand over the hearth fire door, deciding whether to close it or keep giving warmth as the harbor births and consumes them at once.
