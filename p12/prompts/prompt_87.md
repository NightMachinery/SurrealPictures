Vertical 2:3, low-angle view from the lip of black tide pools up to a cliff monastery crammed into the rock; the tide pools are frozen mid-surge as glossy obsidian “waves” that hold trapped lanternlight, while a waterfall pours off the cliff as stacked translucent blocks that look like solid water. On a narrow ledge bridge in the center, two protagonists face each other: **the Prisoner**, a weathered, barefoot figure in a torn ceremonial robe, wrists bound in heavy shackles whose chain has grown into a living mechanical vine of interlocking gears and blooming metal flowers; and **the Trickster**, a monkish jester with a fox-like mask and mismatched gloves, smiling with tired eyes, holding a ring of keys like prayer beads while hiding a tiny lockpick between two fingers. The Prisoner’s open palm offers a freshly broken shackle-link shaped like a laurel wreath; the Trickster offers a small iron cage that is lined inside with warm blankets and candles, its door already open, as if it is both refuge and trap. Between them on the stone, a parchment of pardon is pinned down by a dagger that looks like a ceremonial pen, its ink spilling upward as rigid black ribbons. Behind them, a gigantic **cornucopia** is built into the monastery wall like a carved drainspout, overflowing not fruit but an avalanche of tangible “grace”: bread, salt, coins, bandages, tiny gears, and folded letters—each item falling as solid pieces that bounce and stack instead of scattering. Above, a towering **Simurgh** perches across the monastery’s upper arches: a vast bird whose feathers are layered like copper roof-tiles and clockwork plates, wings half-unfurled to shelter the ledge; several feathers have fallen and are used as roofing shingles and as hand-sized talismans dangling from chains, catching light like medals. The monastery is crowded with details: prayer wheels made from seashells and cogs, bells shaped like inverted goblets, carved saints with faces worn smooth, ropes that become braided serpentine springs, gears embedded in tree roots gripping the cliff, vines that terminate in small ticking blossoms; narrow windows reveal crowded rooms with stacked masks, empty crowns, and neatly folded prisoner uniforms beside ceremonial robes. In the sky, gulls fly with mechanical joints, their shadows landing as sharp-edged silhouettes on the solid water; banners and prayer flags hang stiff as if made of lacquer, yet ripple in perfect frozen folds. Warm, upward golden light crowns the cliff edge and the Simurgh’s chest like earned medals, while the lower frame remains heavy with black sheen and trapped reflections; in one tide pool reflection, the Trickster’s keys resemble a halo, and in another, the Prisoner’s chain resembles a garland. Hidden in the shadows along the rock face: a second set of footprints leading away, a key already snapped in half, and a small gift-box tied with chain that is simultaneously presented and dragging the stone down.
