Vertical 2:3 frame, low-angle view of a wind-torn courtyard at the edge of a desert city: at the center stand two statue-still protagonists locked in a careful negotiation—**The Mirror**, a tall human figure whose face and chest are a single cracked reflective plate, and **The Shadow**, a separate autonomous silhouette peeled off the Mirror’s feet, thick as ink and moving with its own hands and gaze; the Mirror holds a folded blanket made of hammered silver and gently drapes it over the Shadow’s shoulders while the Shadow uses a needle of black glass to stitch the Mirror’s cracks with a thread that glows like hot wire, both of them bracing as a heavy iron collar and broken chain links hover mid-fall around their ankles as if a weight has just been lifted. Behind them, a roaring **athanor** furnace is built into a ruined archway; its open mouth exhales cyclonic air that whips the environment into motion—papers, petals, ash, coins, and tiny feathers spin in a vertical spiral—yet the two figures remain rigid like monuments. The Shadow reaches one hand into the athanor’s flame and performs blunt **material transmutation**: a rusted sword on the ground turns into a loaf of bread; a court document becomes a bedsheet; a pile of stones becomes soft wool; a spilled bottle of pills becomes a cluster of salt crystals; a dented wedding ring becomes a key; tears running down the Mirror’s reflective surface drip as liquid mercury that hardens into small mirrors scattered like stepping-stones. A tattered jeweled battle-standard—**the Derafsh Kaviani**—is physically present as a towering flagpole bolted to the arch, its heavy cloth snapping violently in the storm, its metalwork studded with gems and dangling talismans; the banner’s shadow moves in the wrong direction, crawling upward across the sky as if it has its own agenda. To one side, a thorny **burning bush** grows from a cracked basin and burns with clean steady fire without charring; the Mirror cups a clay bowl of water toward it as if to tend it, while the Shadow shields the flame with its body, turning stray gusts into harmless ribbons. Foreground clutter: a child’s lone shoe filled with sand, a soldier’s medal, a hospital wristband, a sealed letter with a wax stamp, a birdcage lying open like a sanctuary with a tiny sleeping bird inside, a wrapped gift that is visibly heavy enough to leave grooves in the ground, a broken mask half-buried, a lantern with no flame casting light anyway. Background: rooftops bend like waves, a staircase leads up into a blank doorframe suspended in air, and fragments of reflected worlds hang like glass panels—some show the Mirror empty, some show the Shadow holding the blanket instead, some show both walking away—while above them a flock of paper birds circles, each bird printed with different handwriting, and in the deepest corner the Shadow casts a small, impossible second shadow that cradles a seedling. Lighting is split: cool pale dawn on the lifted chains and falling dust, warm furnace-glow outlining their locked posture and steady hands; every surface shows motion except the two central figures, whose stillness reads as relief and stoic determination at the same time.
