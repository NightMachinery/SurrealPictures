Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded kelp-forest boulevard under seawater where gravity is reversed: cobblestones, shells, coins, and fallen petals drift upward like rain in reverse toward a “sky” that is actually the seafloor above, while heavy anchors and iron lanterns hang below as if weightless; in the center stands The Virgin—barefoot, solemn, in a simple pale garment and a veil that is also a fishing net—bracing herself on an up-floating street sign as she feeds silver thread into a hand-cranked spinning wheel, her knuckles white with resolve; facing her is The Volcano as a towering sentient figure of basalt and coral, with a crater like an open mouth and eyes of ember behind salt-glass tears, its posture tender yet dangerous as it offers a glowing “gift” of pumice shaped like a heart that is strapped to its own chest like a burden; between them, the silver thread becomes a visible echo: concentric rings of taut filament ripple outward through the water, snagging on kelp fronds and market ropes so every stall repeats a fragment of their argument—duplicated masks, mirrored love letters, identical empty cradles, identical locked cages lined with blankets like sanctuaries; a huge stopped clock is embedded in a drifting stall canopy, its hands frozen, its face cracked, and small fish swim through the broken numerals as if through windows; nearby, the Cypress of Kashmar rises as an impossibly ancient tree growing upside-down from a floating slab of stone, its roots braided with prayer ribbons and its branches shaped like reaching hands that cradle birds’ nests made of ash; the Volcano exhales lava that does not fall—each molten ribbon ascends in slow, candlelike streams, illuminating faces in the crowd of silent buyers: divers in mourning clothes, vendors with pearl earrings, a child holding a bell with no clapper, an old man selling jars of captured bubbles labeled with dates; the Virgin’s thread tugs at the Volcano’s ascending lava, trying to stitch it into a harmless tapestry, while the Volcano gently pulls back, jealous of the spinning wheel’s control, sending a tremor that makes every stall sign swing and every echo-ring double and triple; foreground: an overturned basket of pomegranates floats upward, seeds drifting like red constellations; midground: a violin with snapped strings is used as a bridge between two stalls; background: shadowed kelp forms an arched boulevard packed with drifting stalls and hanging rugs, and in the darkest fronds a second smaller stopped clock ticks silently with no hands, implying time is both halted and still echoing.
