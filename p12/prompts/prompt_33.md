Vertical 2:3 frame, low-angle close foreground inside a cramped hall whose walls are packed with hundreds of hanging ancestral masks (wood, bone, porcelain, metal), each turned toward the center as if watching; the frescoes on the walls visibly breathe—cracked painted mouths inflate and deflate, fogging the air with dust that condenses into drifting shapes of old family photos, ticket stubs, pressed flowers, and faded postcards before falling as ash. Center focal protagonist: a dancer mid-stride in a fearless forward advance, one foot en pointe on a cracked mosaic, the other stepping into open space; their costume is a deliberate split (one side stage finery with ribbons and sequins, the other side travel-worn coat with stitched patches), their jaw clenched, a tear suspended on one cheek, fingers tense around an hourglass held like a lantern—its glass is intact but the sand glows and runs upward in a steady stream, spilling into the air as tiny luminous grains that become fireflies and then become letters from different alphabets. Behind them dominates the Gate of All Nations: a towering archway built from interlocked doorframes, passport stamps, small national flags, street signs, and carved scripts from many languages, with a heavy threshold stone engraved with dozens of names; the gate is open but the space beyond is not a landscape—it is a dense swarm of doorways inside doorways, each showing a different interior (a nursery, a courtroom, a dance studio, a hospital corridor, a train compartment). The broken-physics centerpiece: toy transmutation—an avalanche of childhood toys pours from the dancer’s trailing hand and from cracked niches in the frescoes (tin soldiers, dolls, wind-up birds, marbles, a toy train, building blocks, a jack-in-the-box, a teddy bear), and as each toy crosses the hourglass’s rising sand stream and the gate’s threshold line, it violently becomes something else at full scale: tin soldiers harden into exhausted real soldiers who immediately freeze into carved memorial statues; dolls soften into swaddled infants that turn into porcelain reliquaries; building blocks click into gravestones and then into apartment towers; the toy train lengthens into iron rails that bridge a gap in the floor; marbles swell into clear floating planets reflecting the masks; the jack-in-the-box opens into a coiled staircase; the teddy bear becomes a massive stitched-burlap boulder that can be either barrier or shelter. Crowd the frame with conflicting clues: a gilded birdcage in the foreground hangs open and contains a neatly made bed; a bouquet tied with a black ribbon is pinned to a suitcase that leaks sand; a gift box wrapped in bright paper is chained to an ankle shackle lying unused; a cracked mirror on the floor shows the dancer as both elderly and child at once; small candles lodged in mask mouths burn with steady flames while nearby water drips upward into them. Overhead, strings of marionette controls descend from the ceiling but end in knots, severed and useless; the dancer’s shadow stretches toward the gate and splits into multiple shadows walking in different directions. In the deepest corners, half-seen hands reach from behind fresco plaster to offer a key, a wedding ring, and a soldier’s tag; the dancer ignores them and reaches toward the gate with the hourglass raised, the rising sand lighting their path through the press of watching masks and the breathing walls.
