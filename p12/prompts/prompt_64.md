Vertical 2:3 composition seen from a behind-the-curtain vantage: the viewer peers through layers of translucent textiles (sweating silk, gauze, organza) that hang in the extreme foreground, their embroidered patterns casting prismatic shadows; a hand-sized gap in the fabric frames the central scene like a private stage. Center: an Alchemist stands half in a cluttered laboratory and half on the lip of a living Volcano; the Alchemist’s posture is intimate and confrontational at once—one gloved hand offers a small velvet gift box that drags on the floor like an anchor by heavy chain, the other hand holds a stopperless vial whose liquid rises upward in threads instead of falling. From the Alchemist’s shoulders coil two thick serpents (Zahhak’s shoulder serpents), their bodies looped like ornate epaulettes; one serpent nuzzles the Alchemist’s throat as if protective, the other serpent bares fangs toward the Volcano as if jealous, both tongues tasting the air. The Volcano is anthropomorphized: a warm, breathing mountain with a face formed by glowing cracks, an eye of obsidian reflecting the Alchemist; it leans forward as if listening, and a slow exhale of ash curls into the shape of lips near the Alchemist’s ear; its lava pulses like a heartbeat and forms hands of molten rock that gently cup the offered gift without touching it. Between them spans a physical Rainbow Bridge / Bifrost: a rigid arc of prismatic crystal and wet light, bolted into the lab’s stone floor on one end and sunk into the Volcano’s crater on the other; along its underside hang dangling keys, wedding rings, padlocks, and tiny bells, some open, some sealed. The defining impossibility of invisible presence & containment dominates the midground: a clear glass cage floats above the Bifrost, empty of any visible occupant yet visibly occupied—condensation outlines shoulders, fingerprints bloom on the inside, a collarbone-shaped smear appears and disappears, and a thin ribbon tightens around nothing; inside the cage, a necklace levitates and clasps itself onto air; outside the cage, the cage’s shadow shows a kneeling figure that is not there. Around this, containment repeats in conflicting forms: a birdcage used as a cradle holds a glowing coal wrapped in lace; a heart-shaped lock hangs open but cannot be removed; a chain made of soft braided hair binds a bouquet that keeps blooming; an hourglass holds lava in the upper bulb, and the lava refuses to fall, stretching like caramel; a bathtub-sized cauldron overflows upward into the Volcano’s mouth. The environment reacts with explosive vitality: sparks become fireflies; orchids and thorny vines erupt from cracked basalt; pomegranates split open on the lab table like wet jewels; melted wax candles drip upward and harden into stalactites; scattered alchemical instruments (retorts, scales, brass astrolabes, mortars) are half-buried in warm ash, while fresh green moss creeps over them as if reclaiming. In the shadows behind the Volcano’s face, silhouettes of onlookers appear only as cutouts in the smoke—some look like celebrants, some like prisoners; in the lab’s back wall, a doorway is both ajar and bricked up, with a curtain tied like a noose and like a bow. Sky and upper frame are crowded: suspended lanterns filled with swirling perfume-smoke, caged comets, and small paper boats sailing in midair; a spiral of rainbow shards rains upward from the crater to the bridge, each shard reflecting a different scene (a kiss, a fight, a coronation, a funeral) as tangible reflections on their surfaces. Lighting is hot and saturated, backlit through the curtains so the textiles glow; the Alchemist and Volcano are rim-lit by lava-orange and rainbow-white glare, while the invisible captive’s glass cage throws sharp, clean reflections that slice across the entire frame.
