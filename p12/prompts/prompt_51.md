Vertical 2:3 frame, centered on a flooded bioluminescent mangrove cathedral whose arched roots form a perfect left–right mirror like a nave; the waterline bisects the scene into two symmetrical halves, yet tiny differences betray competing stories (one side lush with glowing blossoms, the other heavy with barnacles, bandages, and wilted garlands). In the exact center stands **The Vessel**: a human-sized, open-bodied reliquary shaped like a tall amphora with a chest-cavity like a mouth, ribs as delicate lattice, and a calm but burdened face; warm sunrise light spills through them as if they are both container and window. Facing them is **The Celebrant**: an elegant figure mid-gesture, caught between a bow and a command, wearing a wreath of mangrove leaves and torn party streamers, holding a tray that is half offering altar, half scale—one side piled with gifts (pearls, bread, letters, wedding rings, keys), the other side weighed down by stones engraved with “THANK YOU” in many languages, making gratitude look like both treasure and obligation. Between them, their hands almost touch: the Celebrant pours a torrent of glowing water-beads into the Vessel’s hollow torso, and the Vessel tips slightly to receive it, eyes full of overflowing thanks and quiet resistance at once, as if negotiating devotion, debt, and care. A large **Dharma Wheel** is physically present as a halo-like mechanism fused to the Vessel’s spine and also as a handheld object the Celebrant grips like a steering wheel; its spokes are strung with tiny bells, prayer tags, and fishhooks, suggesting guidance, punishment, and celebration simultaneously. Behind them rises a monumental **Sunrise Gate** (a torii-like arch) grown from mangrove wood and coral, blazing with dawn light; its crossbeam is lined with lit candles and also fitted with a lock and chain that hangs open, making the gate read as liberation or trap. The defining impossibility: **infinite recursion** dominates—inside the Vessel’s chest-cavity is a smaller, perfectly detailed version of the same mangrove cathedral, with the same two figures and the same gate; inside that smaller Vessel is an even smaller cathedral, repeating endlessly, each iteration slightly shifted like a heartbeat. The flooded floor mirrors everything, but the reflection shows the recursion continuing downward without end; the surface ripples are concentric Dharma wheels, so every wave becomes another spinning copy of the scene. Crowded foreground: floating lanterns made from translucent mangrove pods drift past the viewer, each containing a tiny folded “thank-you” note; crabs carry miniature gift boxes; a broken champagne flute doubles as a tiny sanctuary cage where a glowing bird rests peacefully; confetti clings to wet roots like scales. Midground: choirs of bioluminescent moths spiral around the gate in symmetrical columns; hanging from the vaulted canopy are chandeliers of glowing fungi, strings of beads, hospital wristbands, rosary-like seed pods, and medals—some arranged like festive decorations, others like evidence. Background: endless aisles of mirrored mangrove arches recede into darkness, where pairs of watchful eyes and half-hidden hands extend offerings from the shadows; above the gate, a second, smaller gate hovers, and within it another sunrise, and within that another, stacking horizons upward as if the cathedral is birthing dawns. The entire scene is densely packed, luminous, and balanced on a knife-edge: gratitude visibly overflowing, yet always weighing something down.
