Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded courtroom amphitheater packed to the edges: tiered benches curve upward like a coliseum, all draped in heavy ceremonial tapestries embroidered with smiling mouths, closed eyes, and tangled legal seals; the fabric billows inward as if breathing. At the center dais stands **The Host**—an elegant, ageless figure in a judge’s robe that opens like welcoming curtains—arms spread in invitation and command, face lit with blinding joy, yet the smile shows slightly too many teeth; one hand offers a “gift” to the room: a radiant paper lantern shaped like a heart, its handle a shackle. Opposite them rises **The Construct**—a towering humanoid built from the courthouse itself—columns for bones, pages for skin, a ribcage of gilded latticework, and a head like a vaulted arch; it is actively **eating its own architecture**: it bites a balustrade made of frosted marble-cake, chews on a witness stand that is also a crib, and pulls ribbon-like tapestries into its mouth like noodles, while new doors and staircases sprout from its back like fresh bread. Between Host and Construct, the judge’s bench has become a long banquet-table of edible law: verdict scrolls as wafer-thin parchment, a gavel carved from sugar and bone, a scale of justice weighing a glowing eyeball against a ripe peach, and a glass of confetti that is also teeth. **Time collapses openly** across the amphitheater: jurors in one row are infants in powdered wigs, the next row are skeletal elders in modern suits, the next are identical masked twins; cracked clocks hang like fruit and drip luminous syrup, hourglasses spill upward, and a calendar peels off the wall in multiple years at once, fluttering into the crowd. Hundreds of lanterns float through the chamber in a festival swarm—paper lanterns shaped like lungs, verdict stamps, wedding rings, and tiny houses—casting euphoric gold and hot-pink light so intense it nearly washes out shadows; in the remaining shadows, hands quietly trade keys for flowers and flowers for knives. The **Ouroboros** is physically present as a colossal ring-serpent of interlinked lanterns and braided tape, coiling around the amphitheater’s highest tier and **biting its own tail**, while smaller ouroboros motifs appear as bracelets on spectators, as a noose that looks like a halo, and as a circular doorway inside the Construct’s chest. Foreground: scattered confetti, broken porcelain masks, a bouquet tied to a chain, and a cage door standing open—inside it, a perfectly made bed with turned-down sheets; outside it, footprints lead back in. Midground: spectators clap in ecstatic celebration while some gnaw at the sweet stone steps, others carefully feed crumbs into the Construct’s mouth, and a few stare at the Host as if awaiting permission to leave; the Host leans forward in delighted negotiation, while the Construct’s posture is protective and possessive at once, one arm shielding the Host, the other tearing away the courtroom’s edible railings to feed itself. Background ceiling: a painted dome that is also a torn paper sky, where lanterns drift into a sunrise and a midnight simultaneously, and a final impossible detail—an entire balcony section folds like a pastry into the Construct’s hand as the tapestries applaud like living hands.
