Vertical 2:3 frame, centered one-point perspective from eye level on a narrow stair-landing in an endless district of staircases with no ground level; aggressive depth lines of steps, rails, clotheslines, and archways converge to a single vanishing point straight ahead. In the exact center foreground, a young athlete (lean runner in a torn warm-up jacket, mud on calves, one knee wrapped, medals clinking) pauses mid-step and deliberately loosens a finisher’s ribbon from their own neck, offering it forward with an open palm; facing them on the same axis, an elder (weathered face, silver hair pinned back, heavy coat, cane carved with notches like tally marks) stands one step higher, choosing between accepting the ribbon and cutting it with small gold scissors held at chest height. Above them, a wedding canopy is physically present: four stair-rail posts act as its corners, holding up a sagging cloth roof that is half-altar, half-trap—its fabric is stitched from apology letters, race bibs, and torn vows, and it catches loose objects like a net (a wedding ring, a stopwatch, a baby shoe) that slide and thud above their heads. Between athlete and elder on the landing sits a shallow stone basin shaped like a lotus; real lotus blooms rise from it, but each bloom is fused with a small animal—lotus petals become moth wings, koi tails, rabbit ears—twitching gently as water drips; the elder’s cane tip rests in the basin as if to steady it, while the athlete’s fingers hover above the water as if about to wash something. The impossible rule dominates the scene: their shadows are autonomous and misbehaving—on the steps and walls, the athlete’s shadow sprints away toward the vanishing point dragging a long ribbon like a stolen leash, while the elder’s shadow kneels playfully to tie the athlete’s shoelaces together; other detached shadows in the crowd hang laundry, swap masks, and pass contraband between stairwells. The staircase district crowds the entire frame: side stairs branch like alleyways, packed with doorways that open onto more stairs; balconies are overgrown with flora/fauna hybrids (ivy that ends in bird heads pecking at lace, cats whose fur is moss, pigeons with fern fronds for tails) that nibble at ribbons and drop petals like confetti. In the near foreground corners, a “gift” is also a burden: a large wrapped box sits on a step with a bow that is actually a knotted climbing rope, and the rope coils around ankles like a polite restraint; beside it, a small open cage is lined with soft blankets like a sanctuary, yet its door swings inward and outward as if undecided. Midground, mischievous details multiply: a choir of paper planes made from legal documents and love notes spirals up the stairwell; a line of bright, sticky footprints climbs the walls; a grinning street vendor on a distant stair offers bouquets of lotus-feather creatures on skewers; a fountain farther back pours not water but slow-falling medals and buttons that clatter down steps. Lighting and color are palpably gleeful-trouble: warm amber lanterns and sharp teal skylight slice across the steps, creating crisp, prankish shadow shapes; highlights glitter on wet stone, ribbons, and scissors; the atmosphere is dense with petals, chalk dust, and suspended stairwell mist. Hidden in the darkest shadow under the canopy, a small folded note is pinned to the cloth with a thorn, and a tiny key rests inside a lotus bloom’s mouth, half-revealed as the bloom-animal turns its head toward the viewer.
