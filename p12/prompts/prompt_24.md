Vertical 2:3 frame, slightly elevated view into a crowded pearl-reef amphitheater just beneath the sea surface, the moon seen through rippling water like a pale coin above; tiered seats carved from giant inside-out shells (nacre on the outside, rough coral lining the inside), packed with silent “spectators” made of barnacled masks, wedding shoes, cracked smartphones, curled love letters in bottles, broken compasses, cigarette cases, baby teeth in tiny jars, tarnished medals, wilted bouquets, and cassette tapes spooled into seaweed nests. Center stage: a mythic phoenix stands knee-deep on a dais of clustered pearls, wings half-open in decision, eyes fixed and heavy; its plumage is ember-bright yet soaked, each feather a ribbon of liquid fire that drips upward like syrup, hardening midair into glassy flakes that become new pearls as they fall. Above the phoenix: a wedding canopy is anchored to four coral “posts,” but the canopy cloth is impossible—solid water stretched like fabric, folded into crisp pleats, then turning fluid again and sliding in slow sheets; the veil is inside-out, seams exposed outward, while the lining shows faint pressed silhouettes of past hands, faces, and rings. Coiled around one canopy post: a hydra rises from a split conch like braided kelp-rope, each head wearing a different relic (a bridal veil, a mourner’s lace, a graduation cap, a hospital wristband, a crown of thorns), their mouths gently holding offerings: a key still warm with fingerprints, a wedding band fused to a fishhook, a childhood toy soldier, a courtroom stamp, a lipstick-stained napkin, a charred photograph that is somehow wet and still burning; one head nuzzles the phoenix’s breast as another bites its own tail to form a “bouquet” circle. The phoenix grips a single feather like a pen and hesitates over a stone ledger of mother-of-pearl—names engraved, then flowing off the surface as liquid script and pooling into miniature reflective puddles that show different scenes depending on angle (a wedding, a funeral, a first kiss, a betrayal, a birth), while the hydra’s heads compete to tip the puddles, spill them, or protect them with their bodies. Foreground: a heavy gift box chained shut sits open anyway—its lid a sanctuary-cage—inside are tiny glowing eggs made of salt and ash; a rusted music box turns without sound, leaking solid notes as sharp crystal beads; a doorframe stands freestanding in sand, but it opens inward to reveal the amphitheater again, inside-out recursion. Background: coral arches are peeled back like turned-out pockets, exposing hidden rooms crammed with stored objects—ticket stubs, dried flowers, maps with routes scratched out, bottles of perfume, courtroom files, prayer beads, condoms, wedding invitations, ashes in an urn—while pearl “raindrops” float upward and burst into brief, warm sparks that die into cold bubbles; the entire scene is lit by shallow moonlight and soft bioluminescence, with drifting silt like slow-falling confetti and a long, tender shadow of the phoenix stretched across the crowd as if the amphitheater is both birthing it and swallowing it.
