Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view into a cramped ancestral hall that is half nursery, half mausoleum: in the foreground a tall, hooded humanoid Shadow stands at the threshold, its body a dense darkness with frayed edges and two faint, watchful eyes; one hand grips the Derafsh Kaviani as a heavy ancient standard—tattered leather banner sewn with gold thread, studded with uneven gems, long red/green/violet ribbons hanging like tendons—while the other hand hovers in hesitation over an open inheritance chest that is also a cradle, packed with heirlooms (a cracked crown, a wedding ring threaded on a dog tag, a child’s boot filled with coins, a key shaped like a vertebra, a sealed letter pinned by a needle, a broken pocket watch ticking without hands). Dream logic dominates: the ceiling has split into a perfect eclipse—an impossible black disc floating indoors—its thin ring of light falling like a hard halo that makes every shadow cast upward; the Shadow’s own shadow detaches and climbs the wall, tugging puppet-strings attached to the heirlooms, choosing what rises and what sinks. Midground: a family tree grows from the stone floor but its branches are staircases that loop back into the trunk; the “leaves” are tiny framed portraits with missing faces, each frame reaching out a pale hand that offers a gift box wrapped in ribbon that is actually chain. Background: corridors repeat like mirrored wills; doors open into starless sky; a birdcage lined with warm quilts hangs like a sanctuary while its door is welded shut; a long banquet table is set with empty plates and name cards carved into bone; a line of shoes (infant to elder) marches by itself toward the eclipse. The Derafsh Kaviani ribbons thread through the architecture like veins, binding pillars, turning into funeral bands, then into celebratory streamers; several gems have fallen from the banner and sit on the floor like eyes watching the chest. Atmosphere of creeping dread: cold, dim light with a sickly amber rim from the eclipse-ring, deep occluding corners, dust suspended like ash; every object is sharply outlined by the ring-light while the rest of the room is swallowed in layered, intentional darkness, packed with small inherited clues that contradict each other (crown as burden, cradle as coffin, cage as home, gift as shackle), with the Shadow poised mid-decision as if about to pass something on—or refuse.
