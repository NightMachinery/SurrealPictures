Vertical 2:3 composition; viewpoint from behind a curtain of translucent textiles (layered gauze, beaded fringe, damp silk) so the foreground is veiled and close, with droplets clinging to threads; beyond the curtain, a crowded spiral district of tight terraces and bridges wraps around a bottomless cenote, every balcony stacked with books, rusted rails, lanterns, prayer slips, and hanging jars. At the cenote’s rim, centered and backlit, two dominant silhouettes face each other: **the Librarian** (a robed figure with a halo of dangling bookmarks, keys, catalog cards, ink bottles, and stitched page-tabs) and **the Engine** (a living locomotive-heart with piston-limbs, a headlamp-eye, ribbed boiler torso, and a tender like a coffin-shaped backpack, exhaling steam that curls into letters). The Librarian’s outstretched hand offers an open ledger whose pages are actively metamorphosing into brass gears, moth cocoons, and ribbon-like strips of cloth; the Engine leans in as if to accept or devour it, one piston-hand gently cradling the book while another tightens a bolt through the spine. A **Derafsh Kaviani** banner is physically present as a heavy, jewel-studded standard: it is lashed between them like a treaty, but also draped like a shroud over the Engine’s shoulder; its torn edge is being rewritten by the Librarian with a quill that drips black wax. A **death’s-head moth** is present in the scene as both creature and omen: one large moth perches on the Librarian’s wrist with its skull-mark visible, while dozens of smaller moths orbit the backlit silhouettes, their wings catching stray sparks from the Engine; a moth-shaped shadow falls across the banner like a seal. The defining impossible feature dominates the sky and architecture: **weather containment** is literal—an iron birdcage hung from a bridge contains a miniature thunderstorm (rain swirling in circles, lightning trapped between bars), and nearby vendors bottle fog and hail in glass vials; meanwhile **celestial descent** is in motion—stars and small moons fall like slow coins, some caught in nets strung between rooftops, others dropping into the cenote where their reflections stretch downward without end, and one cracked crescent moon is being lowered on chains past the spiral walkways as if into a well. The district reacts to transformation: stair-steps are half-book spines and half-rail ties; street signs peel into feathers; a clock face melts into a gear train; paper cranes fold themselves from discarded library receipts and then rust into metal mid-flight. The frame is crowded with conflicting clues of sanctuary and captivity: a child-sized reading nook is built inside a steel cage lined with cushions; a wedding ring sits on a greasy wrench; a bouquet of wilted lilies is wired to a smokestack; a gift box is strapped to an anvil; a cradle rocks beside a scrap heap of burned books. Surrounding the protagonists, a dense object halo floats in the backlight—keys, loose teeth of gears, moth scales, torn catalog drawers, rosary-like chains of rivets, rain droplets suspended as beads, and star fragments—while below them mourners, mechanics, and masked clerks pack the spiral bridges, holding umbrellas turned inside-out to catch falling constellations, their candles sputtering in the damp air as the cenote breathes mist upward through the crowd.
