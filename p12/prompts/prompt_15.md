Vertical 2:3 frame, extreme low-angle portrait from the forest floor: the viewer looks up through thick fog and a crowded lattice of black branches hung with hundreds of small brass bells, each bell reflecting flickering light. Center stage on a stepped dais of stacked, weathered books stands a towering, anthropomorphic swan of impossible gigantism—its body as tall as the surrounding trees—neck arched like a victorious banner, wings half-spread in a pose that could be triumph or dominance; one webbed foot pins a torn library card to the steps like a conquered flag. Facing it at close range, a determined librarian in a long coat and gloves stands on a higher step, chin lifted, triumphant and breathless, holding an enormous keyring and an open ledger; the librarian’s other hand lifts a masquerade mask toward the swan as if offering a crown, a muzzle, or a mirror. Behind them rises monumental architecture grown from the forest: a cathedral-like library façade made of fused book spines and living bark, with arched windows of translucent paper; vines and blossoms erupt from the cracks, pushing through titles and stitching pages into fresh petals—new growth visibly forcing the old structure wider. The masquerade motif repeats everywhere: smaller masks are nailed to trunks like trophies, stitched onto book covers, and half-buried in moss; one colossal masquerade mask—larger than the librarian, nearly the size of a house—leans against the library façade like a fallen statue, its hollow eye sockets serving as doorways where fog pours out. A lantern festival floods the air: dozens of floating paper lanterns drift between bell-branches, some rising freely, some snagged and tugging the boughs downward; a few lanterns glow from inside with tiny silhouettes of shelves, birds, and hands, as if memories are trapped within. In the foreground, puddles of ink mirror the swan’s underside and the librarian’s face in warped reflections; scattered objects crowd the ground—broken spectacles, a bouquet made from folded catalog cards, a heavy gift box tied with chain instead of ribbon, a small open cage lined with feathers like a cradle, a stamp pad leaving fresh “RETURNED” marks on fallen petals. The swan’s beak holds a single bright seed like a pearl; the librarian’s ledger sprouts a living branch that blooms as the librarian turns a page, each page-turn making nearby bells ring and causing new blossoms to burst from the book-steps. High above, lantern-light and dawn-gold rays spear through the fog in celebratory beams, illuminating drifting petals like confetti while deeper shadows under the steps conceal half-seen hands offering masks, a ring glinting in mud, and a second pair of footprints that stop abruptly at the edge of the ink.
