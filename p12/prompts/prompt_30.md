Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view from the front edge of a pearl reef amphitheater under a thin sheet of seawater lit by shallow moonlight; every tiered seat is carved from nacre and coral, crowded with barnacled masks, sea-anemone bouquets, broken crowns, prayer beads made of pearls, and tiny spectators (divers, monks, and fish-headed figures) all facing the stage. Center stage: a colossal Giant kneels with one knee sunk into glittering sand, chest lifted in victorious posture, mouth parted as if exhaling a command; their skin is salt-cracked like stone, draped in a mantle stitched from nets and ceremonial ribbons, and their eyes reflect the moon like two coins. The Giant holds a massive stopped clock like a shield—its glass face spiderwebbed, hands frozen at an exact time, the ticking mechanism exposed and packed with sand, coral polyps growing through the gears; a ring of smaller wristwatches and pocketwatches orbit the stopped clock in a perfect circle, all hovering and all stopped. The defining impossibility: a tidal wave is levitating—an enormous wall of ocean water suspended above and around the amphitheater like a crown-shaped ring, curling inward but never crashing; inside the wave hang floating objects caught mid-surge (a lifeboat, a chandelier, a suitcase, a wedding veil, a judge’s gavel, a baby’s crib, a rusted anchor) all perfectly still, droplets hanging like beads. The Giant’s other hand is slowly turning a circular mechanism of pearl steps at their feet—an endless spiral staircase that loops back into itself; as it turns, the amphitheater’s tiers subtly rearrange into repeating patterns, like a ritual cycle resetting, while identical offerings (keys, apples, medals, knives, flowers) appear again and again in different hands across the crowd. Foreground details: a procession of small figures climbs the Giant’s shadow like a ramp, carrying banners made from seaweed and parchment, some cheering, some kneeling, some placing shackles at the Giant’s toes as if gifting them; a cage made of coral sits open like a sanctuary with a sleeping bird inside; a laurel wreath rests beside a pair of broken handcuffs; a heavy trophy cup is filled with black ink that rises in a thin, levitating spiral. Background: coral columns shaped like organ pipes, pearl chandeliers tangled in kelp, mirrored shells reflecting the Giant from conflicting angles; high above, the levitating wave casts bright rippling caustics that look like confetti over the stage, while in the deepest shadows beneath the seats, hidden hands reset the same stopped clocks in a loop without ever moving the hands. The entire frame is densely packed with floating pearls, suspended sand grains, and orbiting ritual objects circling the Giant and the frozen wave, emphasizing triumphant upward motion and arrested time.
