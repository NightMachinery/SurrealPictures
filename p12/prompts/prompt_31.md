Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded from bottom edge to top edge: in the foreground, a colossal open stone hand juts from the sand like a ruined monument, palm facing up as a working table; each fingertip is a different tomb-studio chimney exhaling sparks, and the creases of the palm are narrow streets packed with miniature market stalls, tools, and tiny gravestones converted into workbenches. Centered on the palm stands The Avatar—an androgynous traveler with a pack of mismatched relics (a cracked locket, a cassette tape, a toy soldier, a wedding veil, a tarnished medal, a shattered phone screen) strapped like armor—one bare foot planted in wet clay, the other in ash, jaw set in defiance; their face is half-hidden by a removable mask held in their own hand while their real face is visible beneath, eyes fixed upward as if refusing a verdict. Opposite them, dominating the same focal plane, an oversized Crow balances on a spindle made from a femur and a loom-beam, wings half-spread like a negotiator’s cloak; the Crow’s beak gently grips a thin red thread that emerges from the Avatar’s chest (not blood, a thread), tugging it toward a doorframe floating at head height with no wall attached. Around the Avatar and Crow, the necropolis is converted into artisan studios carved into mausoleums: open sarcophagi function as drawers, skull niches hold paint pots and coins, bone-handled chisels stand upright like reeds; a glassblower’s furnace glows inside a crypt-mouth, and molten glass flows uphill into bottles that whisper with tiny open mouths; clay jars have eyelids and stare; a sewing machine walks on needle-legs, dragging a quilt of faded maps. The impossible, defining physics-break: objects are personified and displaced—coffins stroll on wooden feet carrying steaming bread, framed photographs flutter like birds, a grandfather clock’s face turns to watch the Avatar, and shadows detach from bodies to trade places with other shadows on the sand; the Crow’s shadow sits on the Avatar’s shoulder while the Avatar’s shadow perches on the Crow’s back. Encode memory/nostalgia everywhere as tangible debris: translucent film strips hang like laundry across tomb arches, Polaroids float in vertical stacks like bricks, and a music box is pried open to reveal a tiny desert inside it with smaller tombs inside that desert; some relics look freshly polished while their “before” versions—rusted, broken, sand-blasted—hover inches beside them as echo-duplicates. The temporal “before-and-after” tableau: the Avatar appears in three faint, sequential positions stepping forward across the palm lines (first hesitating, then reaching, then pulling back), while the Crow also repeats in staggered wingbeats (first offering, then snatching, then shielding); their footprints are layered as fresh prints, then fossilized impressions, then erased smooth—three states occupying the same sand. Weave in conflicting clues: a birdcage shaped like a ribcage rests open in the palm-street, inside it a perfectly made bed and a warm lamp (sanctuary), outside it a broken shackle and a padlock with the key already inserted (release or trap); a gift-wrapped box sits on the Avatar’s pack but is heavy enough to bend the straps, its ribbon biting into fabric like a restraint. The Death’s-head moth is physically present and undeniable: enormous, hovering above the Avatar’s raised mask, wings patterned like a skull and also like a folded letter; it sheds dust that becomes tiny drifting memories—miniature keys, teeth, dried flowers—each with a faint human eye. The atmosphere is rebellious fire made visible: torchlight and furnace-glow paint everything with hot reds and amber; sparks fall like embers-snow; a banner stitched from old love letters burns without being consumed; the Avatar holds a lit match close to their own mask as if daring it to ignite, while the Crow leans in, torn between stopping the flame and feeding it. Fill the background to the top edge with stacked sandstone tomb façades turned into busy workshops, ladders, ropes, hanging rugs, dangling tools, and floating doorways; in the high sky, displaced windows drift like kites showing mismatched scenes (a childhood kitchen, a hospital corridor, a classroom, a wedding aisle, an empty motel), none connected to any wall, while below them a procession of animated objects—teapots, suitcases, hourglasses—marches along the rim of the giant hand as if the entire necropolis is remembering and arguing at once.
