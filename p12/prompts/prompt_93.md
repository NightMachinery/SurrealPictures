Vertical 2:3 composition, low viewpoint at the waterline inside a crowded cypress marsh: in extreme foreground, two oversized hands dominate the lower frame—on the left, a widow’s pale hands in damp black lace and a torn wedding veil ribbon; on the right, a Construct’s articulated brass-and-porcelain hands with visible gears and reeds threaded through the knuckles—both sets of hands locked in a deliberate, quiet negotiation over two objects: a heavy victory wreath (laurel leaves forged from tarnished medals, cypress needles, and small interlocking cogs) being pressed down like a burden, and a compact athanor furnace-crucible being lifted like an offering (a squat metal belly with a round window where “fire” is impossibly a perfectly still pool, its surface reflecting faces that aren’t present). Around the wrists, chains made of flowing water behave like solid links, yet they continuously pour downward; droplets hang mid-fall as hard beads; ripples in the marsh are frozen in place like glass rings, as if the entire swamp has been paused. Midground: black cypress trunks rise like organ pipes; their roots become pistons and crankshafts half-submerged among lilies shaped like washers; a stopped metronome sits on a stump with its arm arrested mid-swing; dragonflies and a heron are suspended motionless above the water, each wing joint replaced by tiny clockwork hinges. Background: one small, distant figure stands centered on a floating shrine—The Widow in profile, posture rigid with stoic determination, holding the end of the veil like a leash; opposite her, no full Construct body is seen, only its shadow cast by lanterns that have no flame. Above and behind her, multiple floating shrines crowd the sky at different heights, tethered by ropes that turn into living vines and back into braided cables; each shrine is cluttered with contradictory relics: an open birdcage lined with blankets like a sanctuary, a cradle carved from a coffin lid, a judge’s scales made of seashells, a ceremonial sword stuck into a bouquet, a ring box filled with ashes, a keyhole with no door, a door floating with no wall. The athanor’s chimney vents silent “smoke” that behaves like solid fabric, draped in folds across the scene; where it touches water, the water becomes polished stone and continues to flow anyway. Hidden in the shadows between roots: a crown of thorns made of springs, a wreath-shaped bruise on the mud, and a small mechanical heart half-grown into a cypress knee, all under a sky packed with still storm-clouds shaped like gears. Lighting: cold iron-blue swamp gloom cut by a single amber beam that pins the hands and distant widow in sharp relief, emphasizing resolve and the unbearable hush of a world paused mid-decision.
