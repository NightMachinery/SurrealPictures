Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view from the flooded orchestra pit looking up into a collapsed opera house whose architecture has fused with nature: velvet balconies have become mossy cliffs, cracked marble columns sprout bark and leaves, and phosphorescent ivy has grown into railings, arches, and organ pipes, glowing blue-green and crawling over everything like a living blueprint. Center stage stands a maypole made from a fallen proscenium pillar fused with a tree trunk; ribbons of torn curtain, ivy-vine, and braided sheet-music spiral around it and stretch outward like taut lines of fate—some ribbons tied around the wrist of **The Friend** (a stoic figure in simple, clean, pale clothes, knees muddy, posture upright), others looped around **The Avatar** (a human-shaped presence assembled from stacked opera masks and mirror shards, with an empty oval faceplate and a costume stitched from stage banners). The Friend steps forward with calm determination, offering a shallow bowl of perfectly clear water in both hands; the Avatar leans back as if resisting yet cannot let go, gripping a heavy ribbon bundle like a gift that is also an anchor. Embedded in the stage floor between them is an ancient brass fire-altar holding the **Eternal Flame of Atar**—a steady, unmoving flame inside a cracked glass dome, its warm amber light refusing to flicker despite dripping water and wind from the ruined roof. Above them hangs a massive chandelier that has become a **stopped clock**: a circular clockface fused to bent brass arms and ivy, its hands frozen at an ambiguous hour, the cracked numerals filled with glowing leaves; a second stopped pocket watch lies open in the Friend’s footprint in the shallow water, its chain tangled with ribbon. Crowd the frame with conflicting clues of innocence and ruin: a white dove perched on a broken conductor’s baton; soap bubbles drifting upward through torn rafters; a pristine lily growing out of a cracked opera mask; a small birdcage on the stage edge with the door wide open and a neat nest inside; scattered pearls mixed with rusted screws; a childlike paper crown half-submerged among soggy sheet music; a toppled harp whose strings have become ivy tendrils pulling at shattered seats as if the building is being both devoured and healed. In the shadows under the stage, a narrow door cut into a cello case glows faintly as if it leads somewhere safe; along the balcony-ivy, multiple masks face different directions like silent witnesses; far above, broken spotlight housings float near the open roof like suspended stones, their lenses filled with bioluminescent vines. Lighting is calm and dense: cool ivy light fills the ruins like moonlit underwater air, while the Atar flame casts a warm, unwavering core; the Friend’s face is set with quiet resolve, the Avatar’s mirrored surfaces reflect both the flame and the clock, making it unclear whether they are guiding, guarding, imprisoning, or saving each other.
