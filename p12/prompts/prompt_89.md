Vertical 2:3, low-angle view inside a towering banquet-hall–kitchen hybrid where gravity is reversed: a long Thanksgiving table clings to the ceiling like a second floor, while crumbs, feathers, and droplets of wine drift upward from the ground to rejoin it; a tidal wave erupts from a cracked serving tureen on the floor but rises toward the ceiling, frozen mid-crest, made of plush quilted fabric and soft translucent gel, sagging and stitched with visible seams, its foam rendered as puffy pillows and kneaded folds; at the base of the wave stands The Rationalist—an androgynous figure in a precise coat with ruler-straight posture, holding calipers, compass, and a notebook of geometric diagrams—tensely measuring the wave’s stitched seams and pinning numbered tags into it, while opposite them The Healer—hands wrapped in bandages, sleeves stained with herbs and broth—cups the same wave as if it were a wounded animal, gently pressing it back together with thread that disappears into the soft surf; between them, they both grip a heavy gift box whose ribbon is a chain: the Rationalist pulls it open to inventory its contents, the Healer tries to tie it closed like a tourniquet, their knuckles white where they overlap; above the wave hangs a large Faravahar emblem as a chandelier—winged disc, small human figure at its center—its metal wings drooping like soft clay, and its hanging chains pull upward on spoons, scalpels, prayer beads, toy blocks, and a cracked kaleidoscope, as if the room is being puppeteered; the ceiling-table is set for absent guests: empty chairs strapped upside down, a roast turkey-shaped loaf with the faint outline of a human heart beneath its browned skin, bowls of cranberries that float as red beads, a cornucopia spilling upward into the air—thank-you notes, hospital bracelets, wedding rings, coins, and dried flowers tumbling like confetti; candles burn with flames pointing downward while wax streams upward in slow ribbons, forming small suspended stalactites; in the foreground, a broken stopwatch leaks sand that rises, a map is folded into a paper boat sailing upward into the soft wave, and a birdcage lies open on the floor containing a tiny warm-lit room with a single sleeping figure, the cage door acting like a shelter; background: squashed columns and sagging doorframes bend as if made of rubber, a window in the floor opens to a star-filled sky, and outside it an upside-down city hangs like a reflection; everywhere, fireflies and dust motes sparkle in warm amber and prismatic light, revealing hidden handprints on the wave, faint bite marks on the thank-you notes, and two long shadows—one reaching to grab, one reaching to soothe—meeting at the crest.
