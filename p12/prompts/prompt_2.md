Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded monastic scriptorium with no empty space; a radial composition exploding outward from a symbol core at center: a brass athanor (alchemical furnace) built into the main writing desk like an altar, its round mouth open, its inner glow pushing rings of warm light through dust and ink-mist. In front of it stands The Healer (timeless, monk-physician), sleeves rolled, palms hovering in a decisive yet hesitant offering gesture; their face shows relieved exhale, shoulders lowered, eyelids heavy as if a burden has just been set down. From each shoulder sprouts one living serpent (Zahhak’s shoulder serpents), scaled and alert; one coils protectively around the healer’s collarbone like a sash, the other leans forward to taste the air—both are tethered by thin parchment ribbons covered in tiny script, as if restrained by vows.

The gift is physically present and ambiguous: the healer holds a small wrapped present over the athanor, wax seal half-broken; the “ribbon” is a thin string of lyre wire. The Lyre of Orpheus is integrated into the desk-altar: its wooden frame forms a halo behind the athanor, its strings stretching outward as perfect spokes, vanishing into the room to become taut lines that bind quills, suspend scrolls, and pull at curtains of parchment; several strings are snapped and float upward like loosened tendons. The moment of impossible physics is explicit and central: children’s toys spill from the opened gift and transmute midair into “real” counterparts in stages—tin toy soldiers become kneeling novices with ink-stained hands; a plush bear becomes a warm breathing animal-shaped poultice wrapped in bandages; a wooden doll becomes a small patient made of stitched parchment; a toy boat becomes a shallow basin of clear water; colored marbles become glossy medicinal pills and also tiny planets—each object caught halfway between toy and transformation, seams and paint still visible as organs, tools, seeds, birds, and letters emerge.

Living ink is everywhere and behaves like a swarm: black ink leaks from inkwells and manuscripts, crawling up table legs and across the floor as if it has muscles; it forms small hands that lift dropped quills, fish that swim through air, and birds that perch on the lyre strings; thick ink tendrils radiate from the athanor like sunbeams, writing and erasing words on the same pages as they pass. Foreground: overturned apothecary jars, broken chains, a heavy keyring, a spilled ladle of ink that shapes itself into a doorway; a gilded cage sits open with a pillow inside (sanctuary or prison), and a sealed confession letter sits beside a bowl of bread. Midground: monks’ desks stacked with illuminated pages, scalpels beside prayer beads, bandages woven from parchment margins, a mortar and pestle grinding dried flowers and ink flakes; a scale balance hangs from one lyre string, weighed down by a single feather on one side and a lead gift-box weight on the other. Background: arched shelves packed with books, candles bent by unseen drafts, stained glass throwing soft warm rays; shadowed alcoves where ink silhouettes mimic embracing figures and also looming judges.

Light and atmosphere communicate relief: warm inner glow from the athanor and a pale morning shaft from a high window meet at the healer’s chest, making dust motes and ink droplets sparkle; the room looks freshly unburdened—knots untied, straps loosened, a collapsed backpack of stones on the floor, and several pages flutter upward as if a weight has lifted from the entire scriptorium. The serpents’ tongues flick toward the transforming toys and toward the ink-words, suggesting hunger and guardianship at once; the healer’s fingers hover between feeding the serpents and distributing the gift’s transformed remedies to the parchment-patients. Camera close enough to fill the frame with overlapping objects at multiple depths; strong occlusion, partitions of hanging scrolls, and the lyre-string spokes forcing every element to point back to the athanor-gift core.
