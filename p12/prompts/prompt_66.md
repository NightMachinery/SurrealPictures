Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view from wet cobblestones up through a packed iridescent fish market beneath towering copper aqueducts; in the foreground, puddles reflect neon-red ember lanterns, fish scales glitter like opal confetti, abandoned shoes and a toppled pram sit beside a gift box tied with rope and chained to a stone post; center frame, two mythic figures collide: **The Hailstorm**—a tall anthropomorphic being with a face of compacted hail, a collar of thunderclouds, hands like crystalline sleet, deliberately squeezing a storm-wet cloak as hailstones drip from its fingertips—and **The Celebrant**—a defiant reveler in a torn formal coat, holding a cracked champagne flute and a lit flare, grinning through exhaustion while pulling a reluctant dance step toward the storm; between them on a butcher’s block lies a **Broken Crown**, snapped into jagged halves, used as a basin where eels coil; the defining impossible event dominates the whole scene: **material transmutation** spreads like a contagion—fresh fish on hooks slowly turn into hammered copper coins mid-swing, ice pellets striking the ground bloom into red flower petals, copper pipes of the aqueducts soften into coral and then re-harden into metal again, spilled brine becomes embroidered cloth that crawls up stall legs, and the Celebrant’s flare smoke condenses into glass beads that rain upward into the arches; overhead, a battered **Derafsh Kaviani** banner (stitched leather and jewel-like patches) is strung from the aqueducts as a canopy, but it is being tugged in two directions: the Hailstorm tries to freeze it into a rigid shield while the Celebrant yanks it into a sail, pulling the crowd forward; vendors and onlookers pack every edge—masked fishmongers, tired musicians, lovers arguing, a child offering a candle to a stray dog—some cheering, some shielding their eyes, some silently leaving with empty baskets; in the midground shadows under the stalls, a birdcage door hangs open yet a small bird sleeps safely inside it, a “WELCOME” sign is half-burned into “WE…ME,” and a lonely table is set for a feast with only one chair pulled out; background arches recede upward into steam and hail, where floating lanterns, inverted umbrellas, and drifting fish-turned-keys circle the aqueducts like a broken procession; the entire frame is crowded, glossy, and tense, lit by rebellious firelight fighting against blue-white ice, with the two protagonists locked in a visible negotiation—one trying to preserve and numb, the other insisting on celebration as the market empties and transforms around them.
