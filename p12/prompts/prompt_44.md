Vertical 2:3 composition, worm’s-eye view from inside wet prairie grass: a towering carved lightning-struck totem in the extreme foreground fills the lower frame like an ornate pillar-gate, its splintered wood threaded with glassy veins where a frozen lightning bolt is trapped mid-branch; raindrops and ash hang unmoving in the air around it. Beyond the pillar-gate, the prairie is crowded into a labyrinth: concentric walls of toppled totems, antler-like signposts, braided barbed wire, and broken stone stairways that loop back into themselves, all scorched with repeated strike-marks yet arranged like a deliberate maze with multiple entrances, dead ends, and hidden doors. At the center of the maze stand two dominant figures facing each other on a small dais made of stacked compass faces: an Alchemist (mud-stained coat, fingers wrapped in copper rings, a bandolier of stoppered vials, a portable furnace strapped to their back) and an Idol (a tall, humanlike figure of polished pale stone with soft skinlike seams, eyes closed in calm, palms open), both steady and content as if nothing is moving. Between them, a low glass cage sits open like a sanctuary: inside it rests a sleeping small animal-shaped automaton; outside it lies a heavy gift wrapped in bright ribbon but made of dense lead, dragging the ribbon into the mud. The Alchemist slowly offers a poisoned apple—wax-green, bitten, oozing dark syrup—while the Idol gently sets a broken crown—cracked gold with missing points—onto the apple as if blessing it; their hands almost touch, but each pauses, watching the other’s choice. A burning bush grows from the dais edge: branches made of flame that do not shrink or spread, each leaf a tiny ember held perfectly still, casting sharp light onto the maze walls. The impossible feature dominates the scene: every shadow is autonomous—detached from its owner, standing upright as flat, dark figures with crisp edges; the Alchemist’s shadow kneels at a different angle than the body and quietly empties a vial into the burning bush’s flame-leaves, the Idol’s shadow turns away and tries to mend the broken crown with thread pulled from the maze’s barbed wire, and the shadows of the totems crawl across the ground like a slow herd, rearranging the labyrinth paths by sliding the black shapes under the walls. In the midground, the maze contains contradictory clues: a cradle made from a bear trap lined with feathers; a prayer bench bolted to a guillotine frame; a keyhole the size of a door cut into a child’s toy; a ladder that climbs into a puddle reflecting a clear sky while the real sky is packed with suspended storm clouds and hanging lightning shards like glass ornaments. High in the background, more totems lean inward, crowding the vertical frame, each topped with offerings—salt bowls, wedding rings, laboratory flasks, small candles—while calm, warm amber light and cool milk-blue storm light meet without flicker; nothing ripples, nothing falls, and the only “movement” is the deliberate repositioning of the standing shadows as the Alchemist and Idol hold their still negotiation over the apple, the crown, and the open cage.
