Vertical 2:3, fixed bird’s-eye diorama view looking straight down onto a crowded bridge bazaar stretched between two looming bell towers; the bridge is packed edge-to-edge with stalls, rugs, prayer wheels, hanging charms, steaming kettles, cage-bird sanctuaries, locked gift boxes chained like burdens, masks for sale that resemble real faces, and circular pathways worn into the planks like a ritual labyrinth. At the exact focal center stands a ninja in dark layered cloth with tied sleeves and calm, victorious posture, one knee on a cracked ceremonial ring of tiles; in one hand they raise a lotus whose petals are made of thin metal plates catching a radiant dawn-glow, in the other hand they hold a human skull used as a lantern, its eye sockets lit from within and sprouting a living lotus stem through the crown. The core ritual/cycle is physically visible: vendors and pilgrims move in looping processions around the ninja, their footprints forming repeating spirals; hourglasses are being refilled by hand from sacks of sand; coins roll in perfect circles without stopping; a ribbon of prayer text runs like a conveyor belt from stall to stall, feeding back into itself; a small fountain pours upward into its own basin. The broken-physics centerpiece dominates the upper half of the vertical frame: the sky itself is descending into the bazaar like a solid waterfall—constellations as glowing chains drape down between the bell towers, a crescent moon lowers like a heavy silver hook, and small planets drop like beads on strings, hovering inches above shoppers’ hands; falling starlight lands as tangible shards that merchants scoop into bowls. The bell towers lean inward, their bells mid-swing, and the bridge’s shadow below forms a perfect circle as if the entire bazaar is an altar. Tiny narrative clusters fill every corner: a child-sized monk painting a halo onto a skull; a lover hiding a lotus inside a locked cage; a thief offering a wrapped gift to a statue while secretly unwrapping it; a masked judge weighing petals against teeth; a wounded bird nesting safely inside a helmet; a map seller whose maps are blank except for one looping path; a puppeteer whose strings are tied to the descending stars. The ninja’s gaze is directed upward toward the falling heavens, yet their feet pin the ritual ring as if deciding whether to cut the constellation-chains or defend them; scattered around them are discarded lotus petals, small bones arranged like compass points, and a single blade laid down in triumph beside a ringing bell clapper.
