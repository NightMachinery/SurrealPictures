Vertical 2:3 frame, eye-level view down a crowded corridor of bone-white walkways like interlocking ribs and vertebrae, repeating arches and partitions creating multiple simultaneous vanishing points through an orchid swamp; shallow black water choked with floating petals, drowned trophies, and pale reeds, with fog pooling between walkway gaps. In the foreground, two protagonists dominate: **The Friend** (mud-splattered, sleeves rolled, face soft but tense) braces themself against a rib-arch and reaches out with both hands; **The Athlete** (lean, taped hands, damp jersey, legs caked with swamp silt) stands half-turned as if mid-finish-line, chin lifted in victory yet eyes wet, one knee slightly buckling. Between them hangs a **victory wreath** made of orchids and laurel—half fresh, half browned and shedding—so heavy it bends the bone arch; the Friend tries to lift its weight onto the Athlete, while the Athlete grips the wreath’s inner rim like a collar, undecided whether to wear it or tear it down. The impossible centerpiece: **memory projection** is broken into physics—each time either of them exhales, their breath becomes solid, translucent dioramas that slide forward into the corridor like glass rooms: a childhood locker room with peeling numbers, a hospital corridor with the same rib-arches, a crowded stadium that is also a funeral aisle; the dioramas collide, overlap, and cast real shadows onto the walkways, forcing the pair to step around their own past as if it were furniture. Above and behind them, a perched **Simurgh** occupies the upper corridor span: immense, real, and close, its wings made of layered feathers and orchid fronds; each feather-face is a thin reflective pane that plays a different projected scene, and when it ruffles, the panes shed drifting, photo-thin scales that fall into the swamp and float like little rafts carrying tiny glowing recollections. Midground: repeated bone arches are threaded with ribbons, medals, and cracked stopwatches; a podium rises from the water but is chained to a stone, slowly sinking; a open cage sits on the walkway like a shelter with a warm lantern inside, while its door swings outward into the swamp. Background: the corridor fractures into parallel walkways, each receding to a different vanishing point—one lined with fresh orchids and confetti stuck to wet bones, one lined with wilted orchids and folded letters, one lined with footprints that appear ahead of the Athlete before they step. Lighting is late and rain-heavy: cool violet-gray sky filtered through dense orchid canopies, a few amber lanterns reflecting on black water like tears; everything crowded with hanging vines, damp fabric, feathers, petals, and small, half-submerged objects whose edges catch the light in the shadows between arches.
