Vertical 2:3 composition, slightly elevated view down a narrow flooded market street packed edge-to-edge with stalls, awnings, hanging signs, tangled ropes, and narrow gondolas threading through black water; no open horizon, every surface crowded with objects and bodies. In the foreground gondola: two mythic protagonists facing each other at arm’s length—The Musician and The Cartographer—both unmistakably human yet impossible: their heads are smooth and faceless, as if the front of the skull has been erased; where mouths and eyes should be there is only unbroken skin that catches lantern light like damp stone. The Musician’s posture is tense and protective, shoulders curled around a strange instrument whose body resembles a folded street map; its strings are tight canal routes, and each plucked note visibly ripples the water into concentric rings that push floating petals and coins apart. The Cartographer leans forward with intent and impatience, gloved hands steady, drawing directly onto the instrument’s “map-wood” with a dripping pen; every ink line immediately sprouts pale shoots and small blossoms that crawl along the strings, turning routes into vines—growth that looks both hopeful and invasive.

Between them on the gondola floor lies a single ornate masquerade mask, heavy and wet as if recently dredged up; it is the only “face” in the scene, its eyeholes dark, its ribbon tangled around a compass and a sprig of fresh flowers. The Cartographer keeps trying to place the mask over the Musician’s blank face like a negotiation or a claim, while the Musician’s free hand holds it back by the ribbon, as if refusing an identity. Behind them, a rainbow bridge (Bifrost) exists physically but wrongly: a slick, arched band of luminous material spanning rooftop to rooftop, sagging under its own weight like soaked fabric, dripping colored water into the canal; it doubles as a crowded clothesline where dozens of masquerade masks hang to dry, rocking gently, watching without eyes. The bridge’s underside casts striped reflections that look like moving borders across the floodwater and across the faceless heads of the crowd.

The market itself is alive with contradictory clues: a gilded birdcage sits on a floating crate, door wide open yet anchored by a thick chain; inside, a lush bouquet of seedlings grows like a protected sanctuary, while outside the cage the same seedlings burst through cracked wood and climb toward throats and wrists. A stall displays wedding garlands beside funeral wreaths; a vendor weighs gemstones against dried bread; a child-sized life jacket is stuffed with fresh lilies. Faceless shoppers in cramped gondolas pass close enough to touch, their blank heads turned toward the protagonists; some carry candles, others carry rolled deeds, love letters sealed in wax, and small bags of seeds leaking into the water. The waterline is high: half-submerged mannequins, half-drowned street signs, and a toppled saint statue whose hands rise just above the surface offering a single sprouting bulb.

Background and upper frame packed with details: balconies overloaded with potted plants that bloom from spilled ink; paper maps drift like fish beneath the surface; overhead, strings of lanterns and wet laundry sag under the weight of flowers growing through fabric. In the darkest shadows under an awning, an unseen hand holds out a compass rose made of bone; in the brightest lantern pool, a bouquet of new blossoms forms a precise circular grid, like a map legend that doesn’t explain anything. The overall light is oppressive—low fog, cold moonlight caught in humidity, and harsh market lanterns creating sharp highlights on wet stone—while the unstoppable blooming spreads quietly across everything, as if the city is being rewritten in living ink.
