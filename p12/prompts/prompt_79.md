Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded top-to-bottom inside a vast clockwork foundry where iron ribs, pistons, and gear-stacks form a cathedral; warm amber furnace-light and dusty windowbeams wash everything like an old photograph, soot drifting through the glow. Center foreground: two mythic figures stand on a moving platform of interlocked watch-gears while silk conveyor belts slide past them like slow rivers—The Matchmaker (upright, deliberate) and The Dreamer (weightless, absorbed). The Matchmaker wears a heavy victory wreath made of tarnished laurel and welded brass; it sits both like a halo and like a collar, chained by fine wires into the machinery above. From the Matchmaker’s shoulders emerge Zahhak’s shoulder serpents—two living snakes rooted into flesh and metal—one snake nuzzling toward the Dreamer’s ear like a confidant, the other pulling back like a leash; their scales catch the furnace light, their mouths hover near tiny keys and rings dangling from the Matchmaker’s belt. The Matchmaker’s arms split at the elbows into multiple forearms (an anatomical impossibility), each hand tying, cutting, and knotting silk ribbons that run off-frame into the factory; some ribbons connect two wedding bands together, some bind a bouquet to an anvil, some stitch a cracked mirror to a birdcage that contains a lit candle and folded blankets (a cage that reads as shelter). The Dreamer’s anatomy is openly impossible: their torso is a transparent ribcage-lantern containing a miniature bedroom with a neatly made bed, a ticking pendulum, and a tiny window showing a sunrise; the Dreamer calmly reaches into their own chest-room to lift out a small paper boat, while their real heart hangs outside their body on a thread like a pocket watch, swinging inches above a vat of molten metal. The Dreamer exhales a ribbon of silk that becomes a conveyor belt mid-air, carrying mismatched “offerings” upward: a wrapped gift that is visibly crushing a stack of love letters beneath it, a baby shoe paired with a soldier’s medal, a half-eaten cake slice on a funeral plate, a broken violin with new strings, a crown made from spare teeth, a warm scarf stitched to cold handcuffs. Around them, the foundry “works” on relationships: silk belts thread through gear-teeth, dip into dye vats labeled with smeared ink, pass through presses that stamp wax seals onto skin-thin sheets of brass; overhead, hooks carry masks with wet human eyes, mannequins missing faces, and bouquets wrapped in bandages. In the midground, a long dining table rides a conveyor like an assembly line: two chairs fuse into one, then separate; place settings swap names by themselves; forks and ring boxes click like metronomes. Background: towering clockfaces without hands rotate slowly; discarded hands lie like bones in piles; a giant pendulum swings through hanging laundry of lace and work aprons; chimney stacks breathe smoke that curls into the shapes of clasped hands before collapsing back into soot. In the darkest corners, small figures—workers or dolls—silently sew silk onto metal, their shadows detached and walking a step behind them. The Matchmaker leans toward the Dreamer with one split-hand offering the victory wreath as a crown, while another split-hand tightens its chain; the Dreamer looks past the offer, holding the paper boat over the molten vat as if about to launch it, while one of the shoulder serpents gently guides the boat and the other bares its teeth at it.
