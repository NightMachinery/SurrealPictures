Vertical 2:3; elevated balcony viewpoint looking down into a crowded courtyard, the scene partially blocked by hanging foreground objects: a lace curtain of interlinked keys, dangling theater masks, wind chimes shaped like tiny chairs, and a suspended garland of dried flowers that cuts across the top third of the view. Center courtyard: a tall golem of pale clay and river-stone stands half-turned toward a slender musician; the golem’s expression is calm but conflicted, one hand held protectively over its chest as if guarding something inside, the other hand reaching out as if asking to be included. The musician leans forward with intent, mid-strum on the Lyre of Orpheus (cracked wood, gold strings), eyes fixed on the golem as though negotiating, coaxing, or commanding. Defining impossible physics: “solid liquidity” dominates everything—stone behaves like a flowing river without ceasing to be stone; from the lyre’s vibrations, the courtyard’s cobblestones pour in slow motion like a waterfall of pebbles, arcing upward into midair, splashing into solid ripples that form a bridge between the musician and the golem, while nearby pillars drip marble in thick, bead-like streams that pile into sculpted puddles with sharp edges. A long Feast Table stretches diagonally across the courtyard, overloaded with place settings for a community: dozens of empty plates, mismatched goblets, torn napkins, bread loaves, fruit, and a central serving bowl—yet every item is caught in the same solid-flow paradox: a “spill” of stone-wine erupts from a tipped cup as ruby-hard droplets frozen mid-splash, a loaf of bread slumps into a rocklike wave, cutlery floats like heavy leaves on a current of flowing ceramic. On the feast table: a half-burned candle stands in a shallow dish, its wax flowing upward instead of down in a rigid ribbon, the flame shaped like a small solid lantern; beneath it, the candle’s shadow contains a faint hidden silhouette of a seated crowd. Around the table: chairs are arranged as if for welcome, but several are bound with silk ribbons that tighten into metal cuffs; a “gift” at one place setting is wrapped in bright paper but anchored by a chain to the floor; a birdcage sits open on the table like a centerpiece sanctuary, lined with blankets, while a tiny door in its base is padlocked. The golem’s chest is slightly ajar like a cabinet door, revealing a warm interior niche with small figures made of folded paper and clay huddled together, some reaching outward; a few figures are already stepping onto the flowing-stone bridge, while others hide behind goblets and plates, unsure. Background: a dense city of stacked façades and stairways rises like cut-out layers, windows filled with either glowing faces or darkness; banners hang between rooftops, but the banners are actually strips of ornate border pattern that have torn free and invaded the world, becoming physical ribbons that wrap around columns, thread through the feast table legs, and coil around the golem’s wrist like a decorative leash. In the sky above the courtyard, floating objects crowd the air: sheet-music pages folded into birds, spare chairs drifting upside down, a ring of keys orbiting the candle flame, and chunks of “spilled” architecture suspended like solid surf. Lighting: clean, bright, childlike daylight with prismatic beams slanting from upper left, turning the flowing stone into glittering edges; deep shadows under the table conceal small details—abandoned crowns, a single broken string, and a welcome mat that is also a gravestone—while the overall scene remains packed, inviting, and unsettling at once.
