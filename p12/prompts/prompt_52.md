Vertical 2:3, telephoto long-lens compression from inside a cramped aisle of a clockwork circus menagerie under torn velvet tents: in the extreme foreground a crushed pocket watch leaks sand into sawdust where fresh bare footprints appear mid-step and then stop, as if an unseen walker froze; beside them a gift box wrapped in satin ribbon hangs from a heavy chain yet hovers inches above the ground, tugging upward. Midframe, the protagonists collide at the heart of a labyrinth made from brass cage-corridors, interlocking gears, ticket-stubs nailed like wayfinding arrows, and looping rail-tracks that spiral into dead ends: an Oracle with a calm, tired face and bandaged eyes holds a lit, glass All-Seeing Eye (a large iris-and-pupil orb) close to their chest like both lantern and burden, while their other hand grips the Derafsh Kaviani—an ancient, jewel-studded banner on a spear—using its tattered cloth as both standard and shelter, draped protectively over a small open cage lined with a blanket. An Athlete in worn acrobat tights and scuffed sprint shoes leans forward as if finishing a race, one knee braced on a gear-toothed step; they reach for the banner’s edge like a finish-line tape while simultaneously pushing the Oracle’s shoulder away, their free hand clutching a medal that is actually a key with no lock. Around them, dream logic breaks loudly: carousel horses hang sideways from tent ribs as if the ceiling is a floor; a brass lion paces through empty air; a mechanical swan floats backward against a rain of feathers that falls upward into ripped velvet; stacked rows of empty circus seats crowd the background but climb the tent walls like terraces. The “invisible presence” is tangible everywhere—tightropes sway with no performer, a whip cracks without a hand, cage doors swing open in sequence like a breathing creature, and a second shadow overlaps the Oracle and Athlete yet belongs to no body; thin puppet-strings descend from darkness and knot themselves around the Athlete’s wrist like a tender restraint. Light comes from trembling amber bulbs and the Oracle’s eye-orb, casting wet highlights on rusted gears, tear-stained velvet, and gemstone sparks in the banner; hidden in the densest shadows, a map of the labyrinth is etched into a mirror, but each reflection shows a different exit.
