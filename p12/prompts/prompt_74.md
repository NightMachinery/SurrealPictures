Vertical 2:3 composition, viewpoint hidden behind a half-open curtain of layered translucent textiles (gauze, silk, beaded veils) that fill the foreground, their folds catching light and revealing and concealing the scene like breathing skin; through this fabric the viewer looks down into a cramped walled old town where every street, roof, and courtyard is mapped in luminous tile mosaics—glowing cartographic lines, compass roses, and repeating labyrinth patterns—so dense the architecture feels like it is birthing the crowd. At the center, a mythic Healer stands on a small balcony-bridge above a narrow alley, posture gentle but tense, arms outstretched in a deliberate choice: one hand holds a heavy cornucopia like an offering and a burden at once, spilling not food but objects that contradict each other (bandages, coins, teeth, seeds, keys, tiny cages, wedding rings, broken hourglasses) that clatter into the mosaic and begin to arrange themselves into concentric circles as if responding to an unseen echo. From the Healer’s shoulders emerge Zahhak’s living shoulder serpents—two sleek snakes with intelligent eyes—coiled like epaulettes; one snake leans toward the cornucopia as if hungry, the other presses its jaw to the Healer’s neck as if protective, their tongues tasting the air where visible rings of “resonance” propagate: ripples in dust, repeating halos around lanterns, duplicated shadows that lag a half-step behind bodies, and tiled patterns that reprint themselves outward like a stamp. Opposite the Healer, an anthropomorphic Falcon (upright, expressive) perches on the rim of a monumental spinning wheel that is built into the town’s masonry like a public monument; the Falcon grips a shuttle in one claw and tugs threads that run through the curtain itself, eyes narrowed in jealous devotion, as if negotiating the Healer’s gift—its feathers bristle, then soften, caught between guarding and guiding. The spinning wheel turns without hands, and each rotation pulls a new translucent textile panel across the scene like a stage change, creating literal echoes of the same moment in overlapping layers: the Falcon appears twice at once in slightly different poses; the Healer’s gesture repeats in the air as a ghostly afterimage made of tile fragments. The defining impossible physics is “fluid solidity” everywhere: water in the alley stands upright in rigid sheets like glass walls that people lean against; stone steps pour like thick syrup but freeze mid-flow into perfect staircases; a fountain’s stream becomes a solid spiral you can climb, while solid mosaic tiles behave like liquid, sliding in slow waves around ankles yet never losing their glow, flowing into the shapes of hands, wings, and serpents. In the packed background, the town wall is crowded with balconies, prayer niches, and market stalls; lanterns hang in tight clusters, each casting multiple concentric light-rings that bounce off the mosaics and return brighter, filling the scene with ecstatic, transcendent radiance; masked onlookers press together below, faces half-seen through fabric and shadow, some reaching up as if to catch the falling objects, others shielding their eyes as if overwhelmed by bliss. In the sky between rooftops, a suspended bell made of solidified mist vibrates, releasing visible rings that strike the walls and rebound; each rebound dislodges tiny tile pieces that float like glittering insects and assemble into maps of places that don’t exist. In the darkest corners under archways, secrets contradict the central ritual: an open cage with a lock still clasped shut; a cradle made of chain; a healer’s basin filled with feathers instead of water; a serpent shedding skin that turns into a lace veil; a small figure hugging a stone that weeps liquid light. The Healer leans slightly toward the Falcon with a strained smile of mercy, the Falcon leans slightly away with a look of wounded pride, and the shoulder serpents tilt in opposite directions as if voting—care, hunger, protection—while the whole tile-mapped old town amplifies their standoff into a city-sized echo that keeps repeating, brighter and more intoxicating, until the very streets seem to sing.
