Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view inside a mirror-maze embassy hall crammed with diplomatic clutter: endless corridors of tall mirrors, ribboned banners from two rival kingdoms, cracked marble floors laid like a chessboard, gilt chandeliers multiplied into infinity by reflections. Center foreground stands **The Host**—a poised figure in ceremonial attire that looks half-tailored, half-architectural (their cloak folds into curtained doorways; their collar resembles a miniature balcony), smiling with deliberate control while raising one hand in welcome and the other in hesitation, as if deciding who may enter. The Host holds a **broken column** like a scepter and walking staff at once; the snapped capital is polished into a cup that spills glittering dust. Behind them rises a towering **Tower of Babel** built inside the embassy: a spiraling stack of mismatched bricks made of wax-sealed letters, treaty pages, tongue-shaped tiles, and stamped passports, threaded with staircases that lead nowhere and end in mirror shards; emissaries climb it while arguing in silent mouths. The defining impossibility: **objects are personified and music becomes matter**—the mirrors have faces and eyelids, some flinching, some leaning in like gossipers; a bronze door knocker grins; a chandelier cranes its neck; banquet chairs huddle like anxious animals. The Host conducts the room with a thin baton that releases visible musical notes as solid things: heavy black note-heads drop like weights onto contracts, staffs become glowing rails that bridge mirror corridors, crescendos crystallize into glass waves that freeze mid-air, and a fanfare bursts into physical confetti that rains upward. Two rival delegations crowd the midground: masked diplomats offer gifts that contradict themselves (a jeweled cage held open like a sanctuary; a bouquet made of sharpened silver cutlery; a crown filled with warm bread; a white dove perched on a chain; a velvet cushion bearing a tiny dagger), each figure duplicated and distorted in surrounding mirrors so allies look like enemies and enemies like lovers. Foreground details: a long banquet table set with wine goblets, inkpots, keys, and broken seals; a map that folds itself into a bird; a smoking incense brazier shaped like a judge’s head; a bouquet of laurel leaves pinned to a torn armband; a spilled hourglass whose sand becomes tiny black musical notes crawling toward the Host’s feet. Background and ceiling packed with secrets: balconies full of anonymous onlookers behind lattice screens; mirrored ceiling panels reflecting an unseen fireworks burst; floating lanterns shaped like question marks; a staircase that climbs into a mirror and returns as a different staircase; in the darkest corner, a small child-sized silhouette in a formal coat holds a bouquet of blank papers, watching the Host. Lighting is triumphant and celebratory—hard golden beams spear through the maze, igniting the Host and the broken column in radiant highlights, while the Babel tower throws fractured, prismatic shadows across faces, gifts, and reflections.
