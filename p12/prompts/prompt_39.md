Vertical 2:3 frame, low camera looking slightly upward; a strict radial composition exploding outward from a glowing circular portal at the exact center of the image: the portal is the open face of an enormous pocket watch lying flat in the grass, its glass missing, its gears turning like a doorway; through it, pieces of other places are displaced into this storm prairie—an upside-down chandelier, a staircase that climbs into open air, a small kitchen table drifting like a raft—each object half-emerging as if gravity belongs to different worlds at once. At the portal’s rim stands the Clockmaker (dominant focal protagonist), coat whipped by wind, fingers stained with oil and pollen, expression caught between tenderness and sabotage; one hand holds a delicate screwdriver poised to either tighten or loosen the portal’s escapement, the other grips a masquerade mask (cracked porcelain, one eye smiling, one eye weeping) like a confession he can’t put on. Above him, a wedding canopy is physically present and central: a billowing fabric canopy tethered to lightning-struck prairie totems like a ceremonial tent, but also rigged as a parachute; its ribbons radiate outward in spokes, snagging on horns, branches, clocks, and bones, pulling the entire scene into the radial burst. The prairie is crowded with tall totems (charred wood, metal poles, antlers, church spires, signposts) repeatedly struck by forked lightning that freezes mid-arc; some totems wear wedding veils, others are crowned with birdcages that hang open yet feel like altars; one cage contains a single warm lantern, another contains nothing but a shadow shaped like wings. Emotional weather is literal: storm clouds form dense, sculpted faces and hands that blow across the frame; rain falls as mixed objects—bright seeds, tiny screws, confetti, and salt—some droplets rising upward instead of down; gusts of wind carry paper vows that fold themselves into origami birds mid-flight. Flight / liberation is enacted everywhere in conflicting ways: chained pocket watches snap their chains and float like balloons; a flock of clockwork swallows burst from the portal, trailing minute-hands like feathers; a human-sized key sprouts wings but drags a padlock like a heavy pet; a pair of boots walks away without legs, leaving footprints filled with luminous moss. The Clockmaker’s workbench is strapped to his back like a burden—drawers open, spilling springs, gears, ring boxes, and medical instruments—while a bouquet of wild prairie flowers grows through the gears, aggressively alive. Foreground: tangled grass braided with copper wire, scattered wedding rings embedded like fossils, a broken mirror reflecting a clear blue sky that does not exist above; a small open book pinned by a gear, its pages turning by themselves into a map of escape routes. Midground: the wedding canopy’s poles are actually the lightning totems; under the canopy, a table set for a feast is half-dissolved into sand, chairs empty but their shadows seated; a veil hangs like a net catching falling clocks and freeing birds. Background: dense ranks of totems recede with occlusion, each struck by differently colored lightning; multiple doorframes stand upright with no walls, each showing a different direction of wind and a different season, all misaligned; a distant train floats sideways in the sky, its smoke pouring downward into the portal. Hidden contradictions: a sanctuary that is also a trap (soft canopy that doubles as net), a celebration that reads as evacuation (confetti that is also ash), a mask held like protection or deceit, a portal that could be an exit or a wound; everything points outward from the portal-core in explosive spokes—ribbons, lightning, birds, gears, torn photographs, and drifting stair steps—filling every corner with layered objects and simultaneous motion.
