Vertical 2:3 composition, crowded festival district at dusk, low-angle view from cobblestones: in the foreground, spilled cranberry sauce forms glossy red marbles rolling between scattered lab notes, broken test tubes, carnival tickets, and white feathers; a heavy wrapped gift box sits open to reveal a chain and a handwritten “THANK YOU” ribbon tied like a noose around a loaf of bread. Midground focal protagonists: a towering swan with intent, eyes narrowed in guarded tenderness, stands upright like a dignitary; one wing ends in a human hand offering a steaming plate, the other wing ends in a gloved hand holding a scalpel and a pie server at once; the swan’s breast is anatomically impossible—split like cabinet doors to show a warm, beating heart shaped like a cornucopia overflowing with tiny glowing seeds. Facing it, a scientist in a festival-stained lab coat kneels as if proposing or surrendering; their neck is impossibly long and swanlike, looping around their own shoulders, and their ribcage is transparent, packed with neatly labeled jars of “gratitude” that look like fireflies trapped in honey; the scientist steadies a balance scale where one side holds a golden turkey wishbone and the other holds a leaden wreath. Between them, they negotiate over a victory wreath: it is both a laurel crown and a toothed gear, half placed on the swan’s head, half caught in the scientist’s fingers, tugging ribbons taut like a contested halo. Background: a colossal maypole engine dominates the district—an enormous vertical shaft wrapped in thousands of ribbons that are also drive-belts, turning exposed gears, pistons, and carousel cranks; stalls and balconies are bolted to it like barnacles, packed with revelers wearing mismatched comedy/tragedy masks as actual faces, some masks laughing while their bodies slump, others weeping while they dance; the masks also hang as lanterns from ribbon-lines, their mouths emitting warm light. A minotaur, clearly present and active, stands guard at an archway shaped like a labyrinth entrance, apron on, carrying an overflowing banquet platter like a sacred burden; behind it, alleys twist into a painted maze of parade floats, medical carts, corn stalks, and confession booths labeled “I OWE YOU” and “I THANK YOU.” Surreal twist, defining and overt: the sky is completely replaced by an upside-down banquet table stretching to the horizon like a ceiling—endless plates, cutlery, candles, and overflowing glasses drift above, with gravy rivers running sideways and droplets falling as slow, shimmering rain; between the dishes, clouds are replaced by folded napkins shaped like birds. Everywhere, small contradictions fill the frame: cages that are lined with pillows and open doors, trophies made of bread, bouquets made of needles, confetti that is tiny lab labels, and ribbons that double as restraints and decorations; in the far shadows under the maypole engine, a pair of comedy/tragedy masks lie abandoned on the ground like discarded skins, watching the exchange.
