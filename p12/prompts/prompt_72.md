Vertical 2:3 frame inside a ceramics workshop built within the hollow shell of a colossal kiln: curved firebrick ribs arch upward like a whale’s skeleton, shelves and ladders climb the walls, packed with wet jars, cracked amphorae, kiln stilts, glaze bowls, tongs, brushes, stamps, molds, and strings of tiny fired charms; the air is dense with clay dust and heat shimmer, and every surface is crowded with fingerprints, soot, and half-finished faces pressed into slabs. In the center foreground, a ram-headed figure (tall, muscular, fur dusted with white slip) leans forward in a fearless advance, one hoof planted on a spinning pottery wheel, the other stepping toward a perfectly circular black void cut into the kiln floor like an unglazed aperture; the void drinks light and reveals no depth, yet it pulls at loose ribbons, labels, and ash as if breathing. Opposing him at arm’s length stands a solemn vizier (human, ageless, layered robes weighted with clay seals and keys, heavy ringed hands), body turned as if to block and guide at once; from the vizier’s shoulders rise two living serpents like Zahhak’s shoulder serpents, their bodies draped across his chest and back—one serpent’s mouth gentle, nudging a bandage and offering a shard like a remedy, the other serpent’s mouth open in a silent threat, fangs hovering near the vizier’s ear as if whispering orders; both serpents wear tiny ceramic collars stamped with unreadable marks. Between ram and vizier, a large ankh made of fired clay and inlaid with metallic glaze hangs from a chain like a measuring tool; the ankh is also a latch: its loop hooks into a small barred cage that sits on the wheel, but the cage is lined with soft kiln wool and cradles an enchanted rose whose petals are real yet dusted with powdered glaze; the rose sheds ember-like droplets that fall upward, sticking to the kiln ceiling as glowing beads. The ram offers the vizier a sealed gift box made from raw clay, but it sags under its own weight like a burden; the vizier holds out a contract written on a thin slab of leather-hard clay, and the slab is cracking down the middle, the fissure aligned with the black void. The defining impossibility: every shadow in the workshop has autonomy—shadows detach cleanly from bodies and objects, sliding over brick and shelves like dark cloth; the ram’s shadow strides ahead of him toward the void with a spear-shaped kiln tool, while the ram himself is still stepping; the vizier’s shadow kneels behind the cage, hands raised in prayer or surrender; the serpents’ shadows argue with each other, twisting into two different directions; a ladder’s shadow becomes a doorway; a pile of shards casts a shadow of a whole intact vase; the ankh’s shadow rotates like a key searching for a lock; several stray shadows in the corners appear ownerless, watching. The workshop lighting is a courageous forward push: a hot, bright furnace glow pours from a vent behind the protagonists, rim-lighting their edges and turning suspended dust into sparks; the only cold tone is the void itself, a matte black that makes nearby glazes look too vivid. Background details fill every gap: a wall of masks drying on pegs (some smiling, some blank), a melted hourglass fused to a kiln shelf, a crown half-buried in clay scraps, a river of glossy glaze flowing uphill into a bucket, a shattered mirror tiled into the kiln bricks reflecting the scene from impossible angles, and tiny handprints leading toward the void then stopping abruptly. Hidden near the bottom edge, a small fired figurine of a ram and a vizier sits fused together back-to-back, while their tiny shadows face each other. The overall action reads as a tense negotiation at the lip of the unknown: one figure advancing, one figure restraining and guiding, both surrounded by tools that look like weapons, offerings, and medical instruments at the same time, while the autonomous shadows make contradictory choices all around the black aperture.
