Vertical 2:3 frame, elevated balcony viewpoint looking down into a crowded night plaza; the camera peers through hanging foreground objects that partially occlude the scene: a curtain of paper lanterns on strings, frost-crusted wind chimes, dangling key rings, torn theater tickets, and two oversized comedy/tragedy masks swaying from the balcony beam like heavy fruit, their ribbons trailing into the air. On the balcony rail in the near foreground, a cracked stone bowl holds a **vast glacier scaled impossibly small**—a palm-sized, blue-white ice mountain range with tiny crevasses and a miniature blizzard spiraling inside it; beside it sits a **small birdcage scaled impossibly large**, door open, its bars taller than the balcony and casting long shadows across the plaza below. In the plaza, **the Twins**—two adult-sized siblings dressed alike but at odds—negotiate over the bowl: one twin leans forward with relief, hands open as if letting go; the other twin clenches a fist around a ribbon tied to the glacier like a leash, face turned away; between them, their hands meet over the bowl and the glacier visibly **fuses** with their joined fingers, icing their skin into a single shared glove while meltwater beads turn into pearls. The glacier is anthropomorphized: a face-like ridge forms in the ice, eyes half-closed, exhaling a cold mist that curls into a ribbon and knots itself into a bow; rusty shackles slide off its base and fall upward, drifting like balloons. Across the plaza, a lantern festival surges: hundreds of warm paper lanterns float upward, but some are **too heavy** and drag chains; others are **too light** and lift stones; several lanterns carry tiny rooms inside them—bed, cradle, courtroom bench—visible through their thin paper skins. A long communal table below is set for both celebration and mourning: wedding rings beside black candles, a sliced cake beside a sealed envelope stamped “RETURN,” empty wine glasses beside medicine vials; two chairs are tied together back-to-back with a scarf. The Twins each wear a different mask at their hip—one comedy, one tragedy—yet their actual faces show the opposite emotion; the masks’ expressions swap as they swing, reflecting lantern light like wet porcelain. The giant open cage frames the plaza like an altar and a prison at once; inside its shadow, miniature people carry an enormous feather; outside its shadow, a single huge paper lantern is being stitched shut with red thread by unseen hands. In the far background, the city skyline bends inward as if listening; a river runs uphill into the sky and pours into the smallest lantern; snow falls only under the balcony while the plaza below is dry, and the air is filled with drifting confetti that looks like torn ice maps. Hidden in the darker corners: a gift box lined with velvet containing a chunk of coal shaped like a heart, a bouquet of thawed icicles wrapped in bandages, and a mirror on the ground reflecting not the plaza but a bright, empty morning. Warm lantern glow dominates, cold blue highlights cling to the glacier and the Twins’ fused hands, and the overall action centers on the moment the Twins loosen their grip and the tiny glacier begins to rise, weight lifting from the scene as chains, ribbons, and falling objects reverse direction.
