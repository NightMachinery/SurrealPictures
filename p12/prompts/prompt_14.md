Vertical 2:3 composition, viewer placed dead-center at eye level inside a long banquet corridor in strict one-point perspective; floor tiles, ceiling beams, and runners form aggressive depth lines that converge on a distant doorway. In the exact center foreground, a still-life table sits like a cut-out plane with a crisp rectangular edge: an overturned silver cloche leaking warm steam, a bouquet of keys tied with red thread, a crystal decanter half full of milk, a tower of empty plates stamped with bite marks, a heavy gift box chained shut yet wrapped with a tender ribbon, a small birdcage lined with blankets and a lit candle (cage-door open), a ledger titled “GUESTS” with names crossed out and rewritten, scattered invitations that read both “WELCOME” and “GOODBYE,” a pawn ticket, a hospital wristband, a wedding ring balanced on a spoon. The Host stands behind this table, dominant and frontal, hands mid-gesture as if deciding whom to feed: an androgynous figure in a tailored coat-apron hybrid, calm eyes and a soft, almost apologetic smile; one hand offers a morsel, the other hesitates over a knife that is also a key. A broken crown is physically present as a serving platter on the Host’s forearm, cracked into three pieces but carefully polished; crumbs and pearls spill from its fractures into a waiting bowl. A masquerade mask is physically present, held like a napkin against the Host’s throat, its straps pulled taut as if it could become a gag or a comfort; a second mask lies on the table, face-up, collecting tears or condensation. A Cerberus is physically present at the Host’s feet: three-headed dog curled like a guardian-rug, each head telling a different story—one head nuzzles the Host’s hand with closed eyes, one head stares hungrily at the crown-platter, one head sleeps with its muzzle in a child’s bowl; its leash is braided from tablecloth and rosary beads, loose enough to be kindness or neglect. The background is dramatic and crowded: the corridor walls are lined with many doors, but portal displacement is blatant—one door opens onto a night sky with drifting cutlery and falling grapes; a ceiling hatch opens into a sunlit pantry where shelves are sideways; a window shows an underwater dining room with chairs bolted to the walls; a trapdoor in the floor reveals a bedroom ceiling with dangling chandeliers; these portals are misaligned so their horizons clash, and objects slide through them in the wrong directions (bread rising upward into a floor-opening, wine pouring horizontally into a wall-door, petals drifting down into a ceiling-window). At the vanishing point, the main doorway frames a table set for one, yet the chair is missing, and the place setting is a mouth-shaped napkin folded open. Throughout the corridor, small vignettes appear like stacked poster-panels and mosaic insets: a saint-like halo made from plates, a crown-shaped shadow that doesn’t match the crown, a bowl of bones labeled “PROMISES,” a bouquet made of forks, a child’s toy boat filled with coins, a locked locket spilling salt, a pair of clasped hands sculpted from bread. Lighting is tender and gentle: warm candlelight and soft dawn spill from different displaced portals, creating calm amber highlights on faces and food, with velvety shadows that hide tiny watching eyes in keyholes. The entire frame is packed, designed, and layered—foreground still-life plane, midground Host and Cerberus, background corridor of impossible portals—every object implying shelter and appetite, invitation and threat, devotion and craving.
