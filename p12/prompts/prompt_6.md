Vertical 2:3 frame, eye-level on a bone-white walkway curving through a dense orchid swamp; the walkway is made of vertebrae-like segments and rib-arches, slick with dew, threaded between violet orchids that grow from black water and from hollow skulls half-submerged. Center foreground: **The Weaver**, a tall, ageless figure with calm, intent eyes, bare hands stained with ink and soot, stands in a proud, steady stance while weaving—pulling filament from cattails, spider silk, and fine copper nerve-like strands—into a wide loom made from a broken doorframe; the woven cloth is not fabric but a tight lattice of vibrating strings that visibly tremble, throwing **concentric ripples** through the air like rings on water, duplicating nearby objects into faint “echo-copies” (a second lantern, a second hand, a second shadow) slightly offset along the walkway. Midground, rising out of the swamp as the dominant second protagonist: **The Volcano**, a colossal anthropomorphic mountain whose body is **inside-out**—its rocky “skin” hangs outward like a peeled cloak, while its inner chambers, ribs of basalt, and glowing magma-veins are exposed on the outside; its crater opens into a quiet, candlelit room visible within the hollow (a small table set for two, a folded letter, a glass with a cracked rim), while on its exterior molten “organs” pulse softly like a living heart. The Weaver’s vibrating threads are tied gently around the Volcano’s exposed, glowing core like a bandage and a bridal sash at once; the Volcano leans down with careful tenderness, offering the Weaver a heavy gift: a **molten pearl** cradled in a scorched velvet box whose lid is also a manacle, half-open. Suspended above them from the Weaver’s lattice: **three bone bells** engraved with the prime numerals **2**, **3**, and **5**, each bell chiming silently into visible wavefronts that travel down the walkway’s spine-segments, making orchids bow in repeating patterns like a frozen soundwave; the same three numerals also appear as stepping-stones embedded in the path, worn smooth by unseen feet. Background, filling the upper frame: the **Simurgh** is physically present as a vast bird-figure assembled from orchid petals, bone splints, and tarnished mirror shards—perched across the walkway arches with wings outspread; some feathers are real, some are carved, some are stitched from the Weaver’s thread, and its mirrored plumage reflects scenes that do not match (a nursery crib that is also a coffin; a trophy cup used as an ashtray; a cage whose door is locked from the inside yet lined with soft blankets). The swamp water is crowded with detail: floating keys, wedding rings on reeds, broken crowns, and lanternfish swimming just under the surface; above the waterline, fireflies orbit the chimes in tight spirals, and the Volcano’s warm glow casts long, proud highlights on the Weaver’s posture while soft light pools around the Volcano’s lowered face and outstretched hand. In the deep shadows under the walkway ribs: a small open mouth-shaped cave repeats the echo motif—three times—each “echo-cave” smaller, each holding a different object (a lullaby music box, a judge’s gavel, a single orchid wrapped in gauze). The entire scene is packed edge-to-edge with threads, ripples, reflections, and repeating forms, with the inside-out Volcano and the Weaver’s resonant lattice as the unmistakable focal collision.
