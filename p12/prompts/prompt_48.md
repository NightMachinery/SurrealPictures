Vertical 2:3, centered one-point perspective from the viewer standing on a narrow path of inlaid hopscotch tiles and jacks scattered in the foreground, all depth lines converging to a glowing hearth fire at the vanishing point inside a petrified grove; the grove is crowded wall-to-wall with stone trunks that should be rigid yet slump and bulge like soft sculpture—petrified bark creased like folded cloth, marble roots tied in plush knots, porcelain leaves hanging like heavy satin ribbons, some leaves chipped into sharp shards while others droop like pillows, creating contradictory safety and danger. In the exact center foreground stand two mythic figures locked in a quiet negotiation: a Widow in dark veil and mourning dress whose long veil stretches into a jump-rope loop, and a Guardian in weathered armor and cloak whose stance is protective but tender; their hands meet over a single glass slipper held between them like a fragile relic and also like a toy boat, its transparency catching the hearth glow. The Widow cradles a wilting bouquet pressed to her chest, petals browning and shedding; the fallen petals become tiny paper game pieces and origami birds that slide along the perspective tiles toward the fire, while the bouquet’s stems twist into puppet strings that tug at objects in the scene. The Guardian feeds the hearth fire with gentle care, but the fire behaves impossibly: flames are thick, velvety tongues stitched with seams, curling like plush ribbons that lick upward yet remain soft enough to be held; one soft flame wraps around the Widow’s bouquet as if warming it, another coils around the glass slipper like a protective scarf, and a third flame forms a small ring-toss target hovering above the coals. Fill every plane: left side stacked like a cutout stage—an open birdcage used as a lantern, inside it a tiny bed made from a folded map; right side stacked—an open coffin used as a toy chest overflowing with marbles, masks, and bandaged dolls; above, porcelain leaves form a mosaic canopy where some leaves reflect the figures like broken mirrors and others show faint handprints as if recently played with. Midground along the path, stone animals posed like guardians and playmates (a lion curled like a cushion, a deer with porcelain antlers shaped like coat hooks) watch the pair; behind them, the grove’s soft-stone trunks bend inward like an embracing hallway, simultaneously sheltering and enclosing. Hidden in the shadows between roots: small hands offering game tokens, a cracked wedding ring used as a hoop, a teacup filled with ash and confetti, a stitched heart-shaped patch pinned to a gravestone that doubles as a picnic table. Lighting is a compassionate, healing warmth radiating from the hearth: amber glow pooling along the hopscotch tiles, soft highlights on the Widow’s veil and the Guardian’s gauntlet, gentle rim-light outlining the glass slipper; everything is densely layered in flat, decorative planes with stacked borders of porcelain leaves and stone lace, yet locked to the rigid one-point corridor that pulls the eye straight through the tender standoff toward the soft, impossible fire.
