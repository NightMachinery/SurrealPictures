Vertical 2:3 composition, packed interdimensional ferry terminal made of endless velvet corridors and archways, every surface plush and worn like theater drapery turned into architecture; a dense crowd of mismatched travelers presses in—transparent commuters holding umbrellas folded into origami animals, monks with suitcases full of paper birds, mechanics carrying bouquets of copper wires, children-sized elders exchanging maps that are also bandages—while ticket kiosks blink with destination names that are stitched, not printed. Center foreground: two mythic protagonists locked in an intimate negotiation of care and power—The Healer, a calm figure with rolled-up sleeves and a satchel of glass vials, thread, and tiny lanterns, and The Engine, a sentient locomotive-heart hybrid with pistons that rise and fall like ribs, warm breath venting in playful loops; between them runs a visible “friendship bond”: a braided cord made from gauze, ribbon, and fuel line that both connects and restrains, pulled taut as they each tug in opposite directions. The Healer wraps a strip of gauze around a cracked, jewel-missing crown (the Broken Crown) as if mending it, but the crown’s shards bite through the fabric and drip glittering oil; the Engine wears the half-crown like a collar-gear, simultaneously honored and burdened, leaning closer as if asking to be repaired, yet its iron hands are gently but possessively closing around the Healer’s wrist. A large Dharma Wheel is physically present as the main terminal turnstile: a heavy, ornate wheel of spokes and embossed symbols, rotating slowly by itself; each spoke is also a ticket punch, stamping tiny circular wounds into boarding passes, and the Healer uses one spoke like a compass to choose a direction while the Engine tries to align its pistons with the wheel’s rhythm. Surrounding them: a birdcage hangs open but functions as a sanctuary—inside it, a small sleeping dog made of steam rests on velvet; nearby, a gift box tied with a bow is so heavy it has cracked the tiled floor, and travelers step over it like a shrine. Foreground clutter: spilled marbles that are tiny planets, a stethoscope tangled with a chain, a wrench shaped like a question mark, teacups full of screws, a bouquet of IV tubes in a vase, and a timetable board whose letters are sewn onto skin-like fabric. Midground: ferry ramps extend into corridors that bend upward like tongues; conductors with masks shaped like smiles and frowns simultaneously wave lanterns; two friends in the crowd mirror the protagonists by sharing a single coat, their sleeves stitched together. Background and upper frame: the defining impossibility—THE SKY HAS BEEN REPLACED by a vast inverted sea suspended overhead like a ceiling, with fish drifting where clouds should be, ferries sailing through the water above the terminal as if it were air, and rolling “waves” casting moving shadows across the velvet walls; dangling from the watery ceiling are floating luggage tags, keys, and handwritten letters that bob like jellyfish. Lighting is playful and absurd: cotton-candy colored glow from vending machines, warm engine-light flickering through steam, and shimmering aqua reflections from the overhead sea; in the deepest shadows of the velvet corridors, hidden faces appear in the folds, watching like quiet witnesses, while the braided bond between Healer and Engine glints as if it could be either a lifeline or a leash.
