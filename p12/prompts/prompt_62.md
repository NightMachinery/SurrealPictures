Vertical 2:3 frame, low-angle view into a vast canyon where a “river” of solid glassy water behaves like a liquid: heavy transparent slabs flow in waves, hard droplets hang mid-splash, and the current curls around boulders as if it were soft cloth; the solid river pours upward into the sky like an inverted waterfall, its rigid spray forming a staircase of floating tiles. In the foreground, an Explorer (travel-worn coat, compass, muddy boots) balances on a drifting slab, reaching toward a Mentor (older figure with steady hands, ink-stained fingers, a map stitched into their cloak) who kneels on a ledge; between them, the Mentor is gently pressing a palm to a fresh crack in the Explorer’s chest-plate/heart-armor, and the crack is visibly sealing with a thin seam of light while a torn rope around the Explorer’s wrist loosens. The Explorer offers a poisoned apple—its skin beautiful but bruised, beaded with dark sap, a small bite missing, a faint vapor curling from the wound—presented like a gift and also like evidence; the Mentor holds it without gloves, letting the stain spread across their skin, while extending the other hand in invitation. Near their feet sits a birdcage with its door wide open; inside the cage is a warm blanket and a tiny lantern, while outside the cage a small bird perches freely on the top bar, refusing to enter. Half-submerged in the flowing solid river is a pair of comedy/tragedy masks the size of shields: one mask smiles but is cracked and leaking sand, the other weeps but is polished like a mirror; the two masks are strapped together like a single portable door, and the Mentor’s knee pins their edge to keep them from drifting away. Midground: a toppled courtroom bench doubles as a picnic table with childlike paper boats neatly arranged, each boat folded from old apology letters; a heavy wrapped present is chained to an anchor, yet its ribbon has been retied into a bow on the Mentor’s wrist. Background: a distant lighthouse made of stacked hourglasses shines a beam through the canyon mist, the beam striking the poisoned apple and casting a clean, bright shadow shaped like an unbitten fruit; on the opposite wall, a mural of handprints shows two sets of prints overlapping, one smeared, one carefully traced. In the sky, rigid fish made of clear ice swim through the upward-flowing solid waterfall, passing a floating theatre balcony where empty seats face the canyon; in the balcony’s dark underside, small faces—some laughing, some crying—are carved into the stone like hidden masks. In the deepest shadow at the bottom of the frame, the Explorer’s discarded map is dissolving into hard droplets that roll “down” the solid current, while a single droplet pauses at the Mentor’s fingertip as if waiting for permission to fall.
