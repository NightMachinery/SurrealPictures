A floating customs office for dream travelers hangs in dense, cluttered airspace above a patchwork of drifting fields; the entire frame is packed floor-to-ceiling with counters, brass rails, x‑ray arches, dangling signage, stacked suitcases, hanging lanterns, and narrow stairways that loop back into themselves. Center foreground: the protagonist “Swarm” forms a single sentient customs clerk out of thousands of small beings—bees, paper tickets, grain husks, postage stamps, and tiny keys—coalescing into a torso and arms while the lower half remains a roiling queue that feeds into its own body; its “face” is an ever-changing mask of stamped passport photos, its eyes two dark ink wells that reflect the room. The Swarm hesitates mid-decision: one hand is gently guiding a timid traveler through the gate, the other hand is quietly confiscating a heart-shaped suitcase and slipping it into a drawer that bites like a mouth; the travelers nearby bow and offer objects upward as if paying in thanks—bundles of wheat, jars of honey, bouquets of receipts, warm loaves with baggage tags. A giant cornucopia is bolted to the main inspection counter like a scanner; it continuously pours an impossible harvest—apples, corn, coins, letters, teeth, wedding rings, boarding passes, and glowing seedpods—spilling into neatly labeled bins that overflow and then float back into the horn, feeding itself. The central architecture is a maypole used as the main support column: ribbons spiral around it as conveyor belts carrying passports, dream-fruit, and contraband memories; the ribbons are pulled taut by small uniformed moths and miniature baggage carts, yet the ribbons also tie into wrists, ankles, and suitcase handles like gentle leashes or celebratory streamers. Emotional weather is physically happening inside the building: a low ceiling cloud floats above the inspection lanes, raining warm golden droplets that land as tiny handwritten “thank you” notes; occasional thunder is a visible ripple of applause rolling across the rafters; lightning forks into the shape of stamped signatures that scorch brief glowing seals into the air; wind gusts are made of exhaled breath that condenses into translucent gift-wrap. Infinite recursion is blatant: every puddle on the floor contains a perfect miniature version of the same customs hall with the same maypole and cornucopia; each miniature hall contains smaller puddles repeating again; the Swarm’s stamp is stamping an image of the Swarm stamping the same stamp, and the traveler’s open passport shows a full-page photograph of this exact scene from the same angle. Background is crowded with floating booths drifting past the windows—more customs desks, more queues, more cornucopias—each connected by ribbon-bridges that double as umbilical cords; a barred cage hangs in shadow with a feather mattress and a bowl of fruit inside (sanctuary), while beside it sits a gift box chained to an anchor and labeled “FRAGILE / DO NOT OPEN” (burden). The whole room looks warmly lit from within by lanterns made of honeycomb and stacked grain, yet the edges are packed with secrets: confiscated halos on hooks, a lost-and-found drawer full of teeth and keys, a lifejacket woven from wheat sheaves, and a tiny scarecrow stamping visas. Camera: slightly low angle from just behind the front rail, looking upward through the overflowing counter toward the Swarm and the maypole column; extreme detail everywhere; no empty sky; vertical composition (2:3).
