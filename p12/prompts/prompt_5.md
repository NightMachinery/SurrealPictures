Vertical 2:3 frame, telephoto compression from inside a narrow stone labyrinth corridor: crowded planes stack tightly—foreground, midground, background all pressed together as if the distance is folded. In the foreground a hooded Hermit sits on a low step beside a small iron gate that looks like a prison door yet is hung with soft blankets and lit candles inside; he clutches a heavy gift box tied with Ariadne’s thread, the thread biting into his gloves like a restraint while also trailing outward like a lifeline. Opposite him stands the Mentor—tall, bareheaded, attentive—offering an open hand over a bowl overflowing with handwritten thank-you notes, coins, wedding rings, keys, and dried flowers; warm golden light spills from the bowl as if gratitude is a physical substance.

The labyrinth walls are built from stacked doorframes and staircases, each passage labeled with tiny brass plaques that repeat the same word in different languages; the impossible feature is blatant duplication: the same Mentor appears again and again at several distances in the corridor, each duplicate frozen in a different decision—guiding, leaving, embracing, accusing—while the Hermit also duplicates as silhouettes on the walls, each shadow holding a different object. Ariadne’s thread duplicates too, splitting into identical strands that tie knots around doorknobs, around wrists, and around a cracked compass that points in multiple directions at once.

A death’s-head moth is physically present in several planes at once: perched on the Mentor’s shoulder, pinned to a thank-you letter, and hovering near a lantern whose flame is duplicated into two identical flames; its wings cast skull-shaped shadows that don’t align with any light source. In the midground a mirrored maze map is being slowly erased by dripping wax, while a birdcage hangs open like a sanctuary, filled with bread and a sleeping mouse. In the background, duplicated archways reveal the same room repeated: a table set for two, then for one, then for none, all at once; the floor is littered with intertwined thread, broken chains, and folded origami labyrinths hiding tiny eyes in the creases.
