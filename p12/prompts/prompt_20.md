Vertical 2:3 frame, slightly low angle: an open-air amphitheater carved from a fossil forest—towering petrified trunks become tiered seats, their cross-sections revealing embedded bones, seashell spirals, and faint face-profiles; the entire scene is crowded and segmented by thin inlaid borders like a mosaic patchwork, each irregular “tile” showing a slightly different angle of the same moment, as if the world is wearing multiple overlapping masks at once. At the center stands the Rationalist: a calm, victorious figure in fitted, practical attire, crowned with a laurel made of measuring ticks; one hand holds a brass compass and the other lifts a blank porcelain mask away from their own face, revealing not a skull but a transparent lattice of geometric lines and tiny numbered annotations, as if their thoughts have become visible architecture. Around them, illusion behaves like matter: discarded masks hang from fossil branches like fruit, some tenderly padded like a sanctuary, others strapped with buckles like restraints; a velvet theater curtain is stitched from legal documents and love letters, pulled open by invisible hands; a cage made of golden protractors stands ajar, lined with soft blankets and a keyhole shaped like an eye. Sensory synesthesia is the defining broken logic: applause rises from the amphitheater crowd as solid ribbons that coil around pillars; whispers drift as visible smoke-letters that taste like salt crystals clinging to the air; the smell of pine becomes green musical notes that drip onto the stone and sprout into tiny luminous moss; bright colors ring like bells, shown as concentric ripples cracking the ground; the Rationalist measures these impossible sensations, pinning a “sound-ribbon” to a clipboard where it becomes a neat graph, while a “scent-note” is poured into a vial and turns into a small burning star. The stopped clock is physically present as a giant clockface embedded in the central stage floor, its hands frozen at an ambiguous hour, its glass shattered into mosaic shards that mirror different versions of the Rationalist’s eyes; gears protrude like ribs, and a thin stream of sand flows upward from it into the sky. The poisoned apple sits on a pedestal of fossilized roots near the Rationalist’s feet: glossy, half-bitten, its bite mark stained an unnatural dark hue; a thin needle and a wedding ring are stuck into it like pins in a specimen, while tiny moths wearing miniature masks feed on its sweetness. The Eternal Flame of Atar burns in a carried fire-vessel held close to the Rationalist’s chest—an unwavering white-gold flame that casts triumphant, celebratory light; yet its light casts contradictory shadows: in one mosaic tile the flame illuminates a path forward like a victory torch, in another it exposes hidden trapdoors beneath the stage, and in another it makes the crowd’s faces become blank masks. The amphitheater is packed with objects and beings that can be read as allies or threats: a chorus of stone spectators with cracked mask-faces holding laurel wreaths and knives; banners made of translucent skin-thin paper covered in equations and lullabies; floating above, a chandelier of fossil antlers dripping droplets that become tiny ringing coins as they fall; in the darkest seams between mosaic borders, small scenes hide—an empty cradle inside a safe, a crown inside a jar, a courtroom gavel wrapped in bandages, a map whose roads are eyelashes. The Rationalist’s posture is unmistakably triumphant—one foot on the frozen clock, one hand steadying the Atar flame—yet their other hand hesitates midair between offering the poisoned apple to the crowd and locking it inside the protractor-cage, while the lifted porcelain mask hovers like a second moon, casting a clean, celebratory glow that may be salvation or deception.
