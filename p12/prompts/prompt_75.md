Vertical 2:3 composition, ultra‑wide lens from knee‑height at the edge of a nursery floor, strong barrel distortion with curving walls and ceiling framing the scene; foreground: a puddle that is perfectly solid yet behaves like a slow river—glassy “water” flowing in thick folds while keeping sharp edges, with hailstones embedded in it like pearls that ooze forward without melting; a fallen picture frame half‑submerged shows a family portrait where the faces are scratched out, beside a gift box tied with an umbilical‑cord ribbon and an open birdcage that is padded like a bassinet. Center: “The Parent,” a human figure with calm, heavy posture, wearing a stitched apron that resembles layered bandages, sits on the solid‑flowing river as if it were a bench; their hands are careful and deliberate, one hand offering a spoonful of hail like food, the other hand holding a cradle’s handle like a leash. Opposite them towers “The Hailstorm,” an anthropomorphic presence shaped like a standing storm cloud made of translucent ice—facial features pressed into its surface like a death mask, eyes clear as marbles—its “arms” a cascade of hail that moves like liquid ropes while every individual stone stays rigid; it is mid‑choice: one arm shelters the Parent under a curved sheet of solid rain, while the other arm tips a dense hail “blanket” into the cradle as if to tuck something in. The cradle is physically present and dominant: an ornate cradle that is also a cage—rib‑like bars, velvet‑lined interior that looks uncomfortably skin‑soft, rocking on the solid river without ripples; inside are ambiguous contents: a swaddled bundle that could be a baby, a meteorite, or a wrapped mirror, with a pacifier shaped like a molar resting on top. Background architecture: a serene, motionless hail‑cathedral nursery where icicle chandeliers hang like inverted teeth; shelves hold toys that are tiny weather instruments (barometer rattle, anemometer mobile) and medicine bottles labeled only with blank tags; windows are carved into a giant Faravahar symbol embedded in the wall—winged disc with a human figure at its center—its wings doubling as shutters, casting symmetrical, watchful shadows across the room. Sky visible through the Faravahar window: a suspended storm frozen in perfect stillness—hailstones hanging midair like a constellation, yet thin ribbons of solid rain flow upward into the clouds as if being reeled back; a distant street of identical cradles lines the horizon like parked cars. Hidden in the corners and shadows: small hands in the wallpaper pattern reaching toward the cradle; footprints that start as adult shoeprints and end as tiny bird tracks; a lullaby music box with its lid open, gears exposed, turning without moving; a halo of umbrellas nailed shut above the Parent like a protective crown, while the Hailstorm’s shadow on the floor resembles a pair of wings. Lighting: diffuse, pale, low and steady with no visible wind—every object poised as if time has been gently held in place.
