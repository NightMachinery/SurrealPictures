Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded puppet-opera avenue at twilight: velvet awnings, ornate balconies, playbills, masks, ticket stubs, ribbons, gears, and tangled marionette strings crisscross overhead like a web; dozens of wooden marionettes hang mid-performance, yet each one casts a sharply defined human shadow on the cobblestones—some shadows embrace, some fight, some kneel, some flee—overlapping into unreadable scenes in the negative space. Center foreground: a calm, intent Healer (timeless figure with travel-worn satchel, gentle hands, steady gaze) stands on a circular mandala inlaid into the street like a compass-rose stage, carefully wrapping a bandage around the fingertip of a towering Colossus who kneels to fit the narrow avenue; the Colossus’ expression is tender but burdened, shoulders bowed under tiny theatre balconies like a ceiling, one huge palm cupped protectively around a wilting bouquet whose petals fall as slow, suspended drops. The defining impossibility: weather is contained—inside glass cages, bottles, and lanterns stacked like props along the avenue; a thundercloud churns in a birdcage that looks like a sanctuary, a sunbeam is folded into a suitcase with buckles, snowfall swirls inside a cracked opera mask, and a rainstorm pours upward into a sealed bell jar held by the Colossus; each container leaks only sensations (mist beads on nearby posters, a faint rainbow arcs across a puppet’s wooden cheek) without releasing the weather itself. Midair above the protagonists, a Simurgh appears at once as a living colossal bird and as a marionette: gilded feathers, visible strings, and a keyhole in its chest; it hovers with wings half-open as if deciding whether to shelter them or carry them away, shedding a few feathers that turn into tickets as they fall. Encode time as a candid snapshot with echoes: the Healer’s hands appear in three staggered positions along the same bandage wrap, the Colossus’ lifted finger repeats like sequential beats, and several marionettes show doubled limbs as if caught between frames; a dropped pocket watch bounces in a short trail of positions across the mandala, each bounce reflected differently in puddles. Background depth is dense: a distant stage curtain splits the avenue like a horizon you can’t reach; behind it, tiny figures watch through opera glasses, and on the far wall a “HOME” sign points in two opposite directions. Hide conflicting clues everywhere: a gift box chained to an ankle like a weight, a cradle made from a cage, a needle threaded with silver string that stitches two torn playbills together, a love letter used as a bandage, and a doorway painted on a brick wall with real footprints leading into it. Lighting is serene and aching: cool blue shadows, warm amber lantern-glow trapped in jars, long soft highlights on the Colossus’ knuckles; everyone is close enough to touch yet their eyes look past each other toward different stages, as if tenderness is happening now while distance is already taking its seat.
