Vertical 2:3 composition, viewed from a low stair-landing inside a lantern-lit townhouse where endless stairwells loop upward and downward; the entire scene is framed through archways within archways within archways, each arch partially occluding the next, creating deep partitions and nested thresholds. The image is segmented across the whole frame into a mosaic patchwork of irregular panels with visible seams and borders; some panels overlap like cutouts, flattening space while still aligning to the same interior.

At the central arch, **The Tide** stands as a humanoid surge of seawater given intent and expression: its face is calm but strained, and its body contains an impossible anatomy—its translucent torso reveals a full **staircase of vertebrae** that continues out of its spine and becomes a real stairwell threading through the townhouse; its ribs are also archways, and inside its chest a small room is visible with a bed made of sand. Opposite, **The Guardian** leans in close, protective and jealous at once: a tall figure made of worn stone, brass hinges, and doorframes, with an **external heart** hanging from a chain like a heavy locket; the heart is a lantern that lights the surrounding arches. Their intimacy is physical and negotiated: the Guardian gently cups the Tide’s cheek while simultaneously locking a manacle around the Tide’s wrist; the Tide’s water-hand slips through the Guardian’s keyhole-ribs as if seeking shelter inside.

A **Rainbow Bridge / Bifrost** is physically present as a narrow bridge of colored glass steps that arcs through multiple archways, crossing the stairwell void like a ribbon; it begins at the Guardian’s heart-lantern and ends inside the Tide’s open rib-arch, as if closeness is a crossing that can also be a trap. A **wilting bouquet** is clutched between them: the Guardian offers it like an apology while the Tide’s water drips through the stems; petals fall and become tiny paper boats sailing down the stairs. An **all-seeing eye** dominates the architecture: a colossal eye embedded in the ceiling plaster stares down through every arch at once; its iris is a turning clock-face without hands, and its tears run as ink into the mosaic seams, staining some panels darker than others.

Crowd the foreground: scattered keys, torn love letters, wedding rings threaded onto a chain, salt-crusted photographs, a birdcage used as a cradle holding a sleeping gull, teacups filled with seawater reflecting starfields, and a wrapped gift box so heavy it dents the stairwood. Crowd the midground: banisters twist into spine-like railings; doorways open onto impossible rooms (one is a chapel, one is a nursery, one is a courtroom) all visible at once through nested arches. Crowd the background: tall windows show a cosmic night with close, enormous planets and drifting constellations; the starlight mixes with warm lantern pools so the townhouse feels like it is birthing the sea and swallowing it. Hide secrets in shadows: tiny silhouettes on distant landings reenact the central embrace as a rescue, a theft, a farewell, a wedding, a surrender—each seen in different mosaic panels, contradicting each other while all remaining plausible.
