Vertical 2:3 composition, crowded frame, low camera at canyon-floor height looking upward through a monumental doorway cut into a saffron canyon wall; the doorway is made of stacked thresholds—doorframe inside doorframe inside doorframe—each one opening onto the exact same view, repeating smaller into impossible infinity. In the immediate foreground, a mythic Parent stands half-turned between “inside” and “outside,” one bare foot on canyon sand and one foot on the door’s stone sill, hesitating mid-step; their arms are full of offerings and burdens at once: a swaddled bundle that is also a heavy wrapped gift, a ring of keys that are also tiny rattles, a cracked teacup spilling coins and seeds, folded thank-you letters tied with hair, and a small cage worn like a backpack where a sleeping songbird rests safely beside a padlock hanging open. The Parent’s face shows overflowing thanks and exhaustion simultaneously—wet eyelashes, a restrained smile, jaw clenched as if choosing to protect and to let go in the same breath—while their free hand gently closes the door on a trailing shadow that reaches back like another parent’s hand. The canyon walls are dense with echoing wind harps: thousands of taut strings span between cliff spires, plucked by visible gusts that push sand into spirals; the strings carry hanging objects that clatter softly—spoons, baby shoes, wedding rings, medals, broken clocks, tiny doors, and empty picture frames—each casting layered shadows. A large lotus is physically embedded in the doorway architecture: stone lotus petals form the lintel, and real lotus blossoms grow from a shallow basin carved into the threshold, their stems drinking from water that flows upward against gravity and loops back into the basin; inside several lotus petals are miniature doorways showing the same canyon scene again, nesting endlessly. A living Simurgh dominates the upper third of the frame, perched across two cliff faces like a bridge: immense bird body, human-like attentive eyes, jeweled feathers shedding continuously; each fallen feather becomes a smaller door midair, and each floating feather-door opens onto the same Parent stepping through the same threshold, repeating into infinite distance. In the midground, behind the Parent, the canyon is crowded with contradictory sanctuaries: a cradle suspended over a chasm by harp strings, a banquet table set with empty plates and overflowing bread, a shrine made from stacked suitcases with handwritten “THANK YOU” notes pinned to them, and a hospital wristband wrapped around a bouquet; a trail of footprints leads both toward and away from the door, overlapping. In the far background, deeper into the recursive doorway, the scene repeats with slight shifts: the Parent’s bundle becomes a mirror, the open cage becomes a closed one, the Simurgh’s wings become a roof, implying different stories in each nested world. Warm saffron light floods the canyon as if from within the doorway itself, turning dust into glowing grains; the air is thick with drifting petals, feathers, and paper scraps of gratitude that whirl like a storm but never leave the frame. Hidden in shadowed crevices: a small handprint in clay beside a knife, a halo made of thorns hung on a harp string, and a tiny door sealed with wax—each detail sharp, tangible, and densely packed.
