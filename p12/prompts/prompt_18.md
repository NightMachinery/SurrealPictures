Vertical 2:3, wide-angle panoramic viewpoint looking through a busy interdimensional ferry terminal built from velvet corridors stacked in visible layers from basement docks up to ceiling catwalks; the frame is crowded edge-to-edge with velvet curtains forming hallways, brass turnstiles, ticket kiosks, glowing departure boards in unreadable alphabets, masked travelers clutching suitcases, porters pushing carts of impossible luggage, floating paper tickets, and a river-dark boarding channel below where ferries glide in silence. In the center foreground, **the Child** and **the Mentor** stand close, partly hidden behind a symbolic apparatus: a towering clockwork ticket gate shaped like an astrolabe and cage at once—its bars lined with soft velvet like a sanctuary, yet its latch is a shackle; the Child presses their face between the bars in wonder, reaching toward a perfectly black oval **void** hovering beyond the gate like an open doorway that swallows lantern-light without reflecting anything. The Mentor, tense and protective, holds a **skull** used as a lantern—its eye sockets contain a small **hearth fire** that burns steadily without smoke; the firelight spills warm amber onto the Child’s hands while casting cold, elongated shadows that point toward different corridors, as if offering contradictory routes. The impossible defining feature is **infinite recursion**: the skull-lantern’s fire projects a crisp scene of this exact terminal onto the velvet wall, and inside that projection the Child and Mentor repeat again at smaller scale, and again, and again—an endless vertical stack of nested terminals receding upward into the ceiling’s darkness, each layer showing the same gate, the same void, and the same choice, with tiny departures boards changing by a single symbol per repetition. Around them, clues conflict: a wrapped gift-box on a luggage cart is chained to a marble anchor but labeled “LIGHT,” a life-ring hangs like a halo above a drowning mannequin, a bouquet of keys wilts in a vase of saltwater, and a “SAFE WAITING ROOM” sign points into a corridor where plush velvet drapes billow inward as if inhaling people. Midground crowds negotiate passage—one traveler offers the Mentor a stamped ticket made of bone; another hides inside a birdcage like a private chapel; a child-sized ferry captain salutes from a porthole that opens onto the void instead of water. In the upper layers, catwalks, balconies, and hanging velvet bridges are packed with onlookers leaning over railings, while above them the terminal’s ceiling becomes a deep black aperture filled with repeating doorframes, nested ferries, and drifting embers from the hearth-fire that rise like constellations, making the whole place feel like it is birthing—and consuming—the two protagonists at the same time.
