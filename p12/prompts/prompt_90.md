Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view up through the crowded central atrium of an alchemy academy: stacked balconies, spiral stairs, brass pipes, glass ducts, and many suspended furnace towers (tall kilns hanging in midair with slack chains), their open mouths glowing softly like calm, toothy faces; embers drift upward as if underwater. Gravity is broken everywhere—stone tiles, crucibles, dumbbells, hourglasses, and open books levitate in slow orbits; streams of liquid metal float as ribbons, never spilling, threading between towers.

Center foreground: two dominant protagonists face each other midair in a quiet standoff. The Avatar—timeless, androgynous, translucent skin holding faint constellations—has a halo of rotating masks around their head; one mask smiles, another weeps, another is blank. The Athlete—powerful runner’s body, chalked hands, laurel braided with copper wire—runs without ground, legs cycling through empty space; lead training weights drift around his ankles like obedient planets, and his medal ribbons tighten into restraints as he accelerates.

Between them, physically present and unmistakable: a Bifrost rainbow bridge made of prismatic glass steps and suspended droplets of colored liquid, arcing through the atrium from one balcony to another; some steps are missing and float nearby like broken teeth, making the bridge look both like a path and a trap. The Avatar holds a heavy cornucopia like an offering and a burden at once; it pours an impossible, slow-motion spill that never lands—ripe fruit, coins, bread, keys, teeth, tiny hearts, and blank invitations—each item circling the Athlete’s chest as if choosing him. The Athlete reaches toward the bridge with one hand while gripping a stoppered vial in the other; inside the vial, a miniature version of himself floats upside-down, calmly watching.

High above, perched on the rim of the highest suspended furnace tower: a vast Simurgh, serene and watchful, with feathers made of parchment, mirror shards, and tarnished scales; each time it exhales, a single feather detaches and becomes a hovering page that folds itself into a small bird, joining the levitating swarm. In the lower foreground shadows: an ornate filigree cage that functions as a sanctuary—inside it, a tiny garden and a warm lamp glow around a sleeping egg; the cage door stands open, yet a padlock hangs on the outside like a warning. Along the walls, mannequin-students in robes stand perfectly still on ledges, their hands replaced by glass flasks that gently clink without moving; a few flasks contain calm eyes that blink out of sync with the room.

Lighting is deep-calm and gentle: cool teal and pale gold haze, soft furnace glow reflected in floating glass, no harsh contrast; everything feels quiet despite the impossible motion, as if the entire academy is holding its breath while the Avatar and the Athlete decide whether to share the bridge, steal it, or abandon it.
