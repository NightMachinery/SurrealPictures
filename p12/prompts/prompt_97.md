Vertical 2:3 frame, a cramped basalt tunnel distillery shown frontally like a paper-theater proscenium: thick rectangular border, visible stacked cutout planes for foreground/midground/background, seams and tabs between layers, a narrow “stage floor” of black rock with multiple depth panels behind it. Center stage: a tall, weathered statue (half basalt, half pale stone) stands on a plinth shaped like a human skull used as a distillation head; its jaw is propped open by copper tongs, and inside the skull-vat thunder is being “cooked” into glass bottles. Beside the statue, the Dreamer (adult figure with sleepless eyes, ink-stained hands, calm mouth) kneels and negotiates with it: one hand offers a sealed bottle labeled with a tiny rainbow, the other hand presses a sprouting seed into a crack in the statue’s chest as if planting a heart. Bloom/Growth dominates: fissures in the statue’s limbs erupt into precise blossoms made of crystalized lightning; vines of copper tubing bud into flowers that become bottle stoppers; tiny leaves unfurl from corks; a bouquet grows from the statue’s ear like a crown. The broken-physics centerpiece is “fluid solidity”: molten basalt flows upward like a waterfall yet holds sharp edges like carved stairs; liquid thunder pours from a pipe as a shimmering sheet that freezes into a rigid bridge midair; solid glass bottles sag and ripple like water while still staying unbroken, their contents forming perfectly solid spheres that roll upward against gravity. A rainbow bridge/Bifrost is physically present as an arched conduit of prismatic, solidified spray spanning between tunnel walls; it doubles as a conveyor carrying bottles of thunder, and also as a sheltering canopy over a small cage-like alcove where delicate seedlings thrive—sanctuary and prison at once. Icarus’s wings appear as a pair of battered wings (wax and feather mixed with metal ribs) bolted onto the statue’s back; the Dreamer tightens the straps with determined hands while the wings drip wax that hardens into petals before hitting the ground. The statue’s face shows ecstasy—eyes closed, slight upward tilt—as if listening to the bottled thunder singing; the Dreamer’s posture shows stoic strength—straight spine, braced knee—pulling a heavy chain that both restrains the wings and anchors the statue to the skull-plinth. Crowd the frame with totems and contradictions: shelves packed with corked lightning, labels that resemble tiny funeral notices and love letters; copper stills shaped like ribcages; a halo of keys dangling like fruit; a bouquet wrapped in barbed wire offered like a gift; scattered feathers that are also quills; a broken hourglass filled with seeds instead of sand. In the deepest background layer, the basalt tunnel splits into two poster-like panels: one panel shows the rainbow bridge leading to a bright doorway of white-blue glare; the other panel shows the same bridge descending into a dark vat where flowers float like drowned stars. Lighting is tangible: prismatic bands from the bridge paint the tunnel walls in saturated color while cold blue lightning from the bottles pulses like breath; warm amber from the distillation fire glows under the skull, making the blossoms sparkle; every corner contains a hidden sprout, a bone, or a bottle, leaving no empty space.
