Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view down a dense district of interlocking staircases with no ground level: landings stack into a crowded vertical canyon of steps, balconies, doorways, and hanging bridges, every surface occupied with objects and bystanders. Center foreground: **The Storyteller**—a tall, human-like figure in a patched coat made of stitched pages and ticket stubs, their head an open book with turning pages for a face; a ribbon of printed text unspools from their mouth like a tongue, and they grip a long quill like a staff. Beside them: **The Vessel**—a human-shaped porcelain amphora body with visible cracks mended by gold staples; their transparent chest cavity sloshes with luminous liquid containing tiny floating fragments (a key, a tooth, a wedding ring, a chess piece, a teardrop-shaped pearl), and their hands are outstretched as if negotiating a trade. The Storyteller carefully pours the ribbon of text into the Vessel’s open collar like a funnel, while the Vessel tilts away protectively, letting some of the glowing contents spill onto the steps; the spill becomes a narrow “sea” flowing down the staircase, and in it drifts a small **Ship of Theseus** assembled from mismatched staircase railings, door planks, and broken picture frames, each plank tagged with dangling labels, some replaced by bone-like ribs, some by polished new wood—yet the ship remains seaworthy, lanterns lit, sails made from handkerchiefs and receipts. Above their joined hands hovers a heavy **halo**: a tarnished metal ring with tiny hooks and bells, simultaneously held like a crown and pulled like a yoke; its inner rim is lined with soft felt while its outer rim is studded with blunt needles, casting a perfect circular shadow that frames both faces at once. Midground: an immense **Cypress of Kashmar** grows out of a suspended landing with roots braided around stairwells; its trunk is carved with hundreds of small doors and keyholes, some cracked open to reveal warm candlelit rooms, others sealed with wax; its branches hold swings, birdcages, and hanging cradles, and one branch pierces a stone wall to sprout indoors through a window. The district is crowded with contradictory clues: a birdcage lined with pillows and a lullaby music box (door open), a gift box wrapped in gold ribbon but chained to a stair rail like ballast, a ring of keys displayed like jewelry beside a padlock with no keyhole, a “welcome” doormat nailed to a threshold that leads to open air, an empty baby stroller used as a market cart for knives and ripe fruit, a pair of lovers’ gloves tied together but worn by two different strangers. Background and sky: **celestial bodies descend physically**—a crescent moon like a chipped porcelain bowl drifts downward between stair towers, spilling silver marbles that bounce down steps; constellations hang on visible threads like bead garlands being lowered into the city; meteors arrive not as streaks but as chandelier-like stones on chains, swaying as they descend; a new staircase forms from the underside of a falling cloud, each step a translucent slab of ice with trapped fireflies. Everywhere, eyes appear where they shouldn’t: door knockers blink, balusters flex like knuckles, shadows on the underside of stairs contain silhouettes of unseen crowds climbing in the opposite direction. Lighting is bright and curious: warm golden shafts cut between buildings, prismatic reflections scatter from the Vessel’s spilled glow, and tiny lanterns, candles, and star-marbles create points of discovery in every corner of the frame.
