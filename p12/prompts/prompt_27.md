Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view into a floating circus coliseum packed to the brim, orbiting so close around a huge lantern-moon that its glassy belly fills the upper frame; the moon’s flame flickers like a wick and throws warm amber light and soft gold halos over everything, as if the whole scene is lit by gratitude offerings. In the foreground, absolute stillness: two mythic protagonists stand on a quiet ring of pale sawdust that looks untouched—The Trickster (a poised, fox-eyed jester in a half-smile, mask lifted in one hand like a second face) and The Celebrant (a serene figure crowned with garlands and ribbons, hands open in a gesture of overflowing thanks), both locked in a calm negotiation over a single gift. The Trickster presents an ornate wrapped box whose ribbon turns into a heavy chain that disappears off-frame, while The Celebrant responds by tying the same ribbon into a bow on the Trickster’s wrist like a blessing; between their hands, a small “first blossom” sprouts from a crack in the ring-floor, its petals opening toward the lantern-light, roots tangled around a fallen ringmaster’s whistle. A half-burned candle is physically present as a central prop: its stub is mounted in a gilded candlestick shaped like an hourglass, wax drips upward and sideways in impossible gravity, and its smoke forms legible-but-unsent thank-you notes that curl into streamers. The Simurgh is present as an immense bird perched on the coliseum’s highest arch: feathered with ticket stubs, mirror shards, and embroidered prayers, it spreads one wing like a canopy over the crowd while the other wing is molting into confetti that becomes both flower petals and ash. Time collapse and displacement are blatant and defining: the arena is split into overlapping seasons and eras at once—one side carpeted in spring blossoms, another dusted in winter frost, another wet with autumn leaves—while the same acrobat appears in three places at three ages (child, adult, elder) mid-leap on the same trapeze line; banners show yesterday’s date on one end and tomorrow’s on the other; pocket watches float like bubbles, some ticking forward, some backward, some cracked open to reveal tiny stages inside. Background kinetic chaos fills every inch: spinning carousel horses gallop through the air as if swimming, clowns juggle planets that are actually painted stage lights, fireworks freeze into glass flowers, and a cascade of confetti turns into calendar pages, coins, and burnt paper as it falls—yet a few pieces rise back up into performers’ hands. Conflicting clues for polysemy are embedded everywhere: a birdcage hangs open like a sanctuary with a neatly made bed inside; a bouquet is tied with a ribbon that could be a noose; a champagne flute is shattered but each shard cradles a seedling; a wedding ring gleams on one finger while a matching shackle dangles from the wrist; a “trophy” cup overflows with light but its base is an anchor. The stands are crowded with masked spectators leaning in, hands extended with offerings—fruit, letters, small toys—while shadows in the lowest arches hide mirrored faces that could belong to the protagonists; above them, ropes, ladders, and drifting props form a dense ceiling of suspended motion, and the lantern-moon’s glow threads through it all like a tangible fabric being pulled taut around the Trickster and the Celebrant.
