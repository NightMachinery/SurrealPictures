Vertical 2:3 frame, over-the-shoulder viewpoint: the viewer stands behind a tall, hooded Guardian whose broad shoulder and half-turned head fill the left foreground, one hand gently steadying a colossal Spider perched on the right shoulder like a living epaulet; the Spider’s front legs cradle a small keyring and a thread-spool like offerings, its eyes fixed on the Guardian’s face with a tender, possessive attention. They face a doorway-threshold cut into the air itself: a freestanding doorframe made of joined window-frames, each pane a “nested window” revealing alternate micro-scenes that contradict each other (a cradle that is also a cage; a crown that is also a shackle; a feast that is also a funeral table), all visible at once through overlapping partitions and occluding mullions.

The ritual scene beyond the threshold is crowded: a central Maypole rises from the floor, but its ribbons are braided from Spider silk and soft bandages; the ribbons wrap around the Guardian’s wrist like a comforting leash while also tying knots around unseen ankles deeper inside the room. At the Maypole’s base, a many-headed Hydra coils in a slow circle; each head behaves differently—one nuzzles a bowl like a pet, one bares teeth at the Guardian, one whispers into a ribbon-knot, one holds a lit candle between its jaws without burning, one weeps clear beads that clatter like glass. The Hydra’s scales are embedded with tiny door-handles and peepholes; some handles are locked shut, others hang open like invitations.

Broken physics dominates the space: “solid liquidity” floods everything—water that stands in rigid slabs like upright sheets of glass, streams that form stair-steps, droplets frozen into sharp beads midair, a river bent into a rectangular doorway-shaped block that the Guardian can push like a heavy door; where the Guardian’s fingers touch this water-wall, it dents like clay and then slowly flows back into perfect right angles. A bouquet of ice-hard foam spills upward from a chalice and hangs in a fixed spiral, yet the foam’s surface ripples with moving reflections that do not match the room.

The Guardian and Spider actively negotiate the threshold: the Guardian holds a small lantern close to the Spider as if warming it; the Spider pays out a single thread that stitches the lantern-light into a thin glowing seam along the doorway’s inner edge, as though sealing or blessing the passage. The Guardian’s other hand hovers over a doorknob that is also a heartbeat-shaped locket; the Spider’s thread tugs the knob away at the same time, creating a visible tension line between care and control.

Foreground right: a low table crowded with ritual objects—salt piled into miniature doorways, a ring of keys arranged like teeth, a velvet pouch spilling seeds shaped like tiny locks, a folded love letter pinned under a stone that is also a gift box, a mirror turned face-down reflecting nothing, a pair of gloves filled with water-solid that holds their shape like hands waiting to be held. On the floor: footprints stop exactly at the threshold, then continue as web patterns instead of steps.

Background: the room beyond is partitioned by more window-frames within window-frames, each pane showing a different micro-narrative in tangible detail—one pane: the Hydra wearing a garland like a bride; another pane: the Maypole ribbons binding a chair to the ceiling; another pane: the Guardian kneeling as if in prayer while the Spider looms enormous behind; another pane: the Spider small and cradled in the Guardian’s palm like a rescued thing; another pane: a door opening onto an ocean that is a solid block, with fish suspended inside like ornaments. High above: a ceiling of suspended, rigid raindrops forms a chandelier; between droplets drift tiny paper doors, some burned at the edges, some freshly painted, all pinned by strands of silk.

Lighting and color cues for tenderness are physical: soft candle clusters held by Hydra heads, warm lantern glow cupped near the Spider, gentle light seeping through cracks in the solid water walls like honey trapped in ice; shadows hide small secrets—an extra handprint in the water-door, a ribbon knot shaped like a noose and a bow simultaneously, a tiny cradle inside a padlock, a tiny padlock inside a cradle—everything densely layered, intimate, and ambiguous, with the nested windows framing multiple contradictory stories while the Guardian and the Spider decide whether to open, seal, or step through the threshold.
