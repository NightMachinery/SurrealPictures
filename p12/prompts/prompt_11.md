Vertical 2:3 frame, low-angle view down a cramped basalt tunnel distillery where shelves, chains, copper pipes, and stacked crates crowd every inch; hundreds of glass bottles trap miniature thunderstorms—rolling black clouds, forked lightning, hailstones, and vibrating blue-white glow—condensation beads racing upward against gravity. Centered in the midground stands a heavy arched doorway cut directly into basalt, its threshold paved with bottle stoppers and feathers; the doorway opens onto the exact same tunnel and doorway repeating smaller and smaller into a visible infinite recursion, and the recursion also appears inside many bottle bodies and in puddle reflections, each reflection containing the child and the raven again, slightly out of sync. In the foreground, a child (bare feet on wet stone, pockets stuffed with corks) leans forward with a grin that could be curiosity or theft, one hand tugging a living beanstalk that has burst from a cracked thunder-bottle and is climbing the doorway like a green fuse; the other hand cradles a small wooden cradle like a basket—inside it rests a single glossy raven egg wrapped in a tiny swaddling cloth, while the cradle’s rocking rails are bolted like manacles to a chain. A large raven, alert and calculating, perches on the cradle’s rim with one talon, the other talon pinning a brass key; it tilts its head toward the child as if bargaining, beak slightly open as though laughing, and its shadow on the wet floor forms a second bird whose beak points the opposite way. Above the doorway, a Faravahar emblem is physically present as a forged, winged metal relief with a human figure at its center; its wings are hinged like a valve, and thin lightning filaments from nearby bottles arc into it as if powering a mechanism—yet the emblem’s ring is also a halo-like handle inviting someone to pull. Around the arch, a “sanctuary-cage” of glass tubing encloses a warm lantern glow and a soft blanket, but the same tubing also resembles a trap with padlocks; a gift box tied with ribbon sits on the threshold, its ribbon stitched from raven feathers and beanstalk tendrils, and the box is visibly heavy enough to crack stone. Background details cram the tunnel: corkscrew tools, scribbled labels that show the doorway inside the doorway, tiny paper boats floating in a gutter of stormwater, a toppled barrel leaking shimmering thunder like smoke, and a chalk outline of wings on the wall that aligns perfectly with the Faravahar when viewed through a particular bottle. Lighting is mischievous and gleeful: bright electric flashes from the bottles paint prismatic highlights, casting playful, shifting shadows that create false doorways on the basalt; every surface glints with wet reflections, and hidden in the deepest shadow behind a rack, a small second cradle hangs empty, gently rocking on its own.
