Vertical 2:3 composition, over-the-shoulder viewpoint from behind a rival envoy in a heavy ceremonial cloak (their shoulder and half-raised hand with a signet ring filling the left foreground) looking into a crowded mirror-maze embassy hall where every wall is a mirror that bends like soft cloth: tall mirror panels sag and fold into velvet-like waves, reflecting endless corridors of diplomats, guards, and masked courtiers frozen mid-breath; the floor is a checkerboard of polished stone that ripples like a thick rug underfoot yet holds everyone perfectly steady. At the center, the Beloved—an androgynous figure with a calm, satisfied half-smile, a faint tear dried on one cheek, and a crown made of braided keys—leans forward to cradle the faceplate of the Engine: a kneeling, sentient diplomatic machine shaped like a compact locomotive-throne hybrid with visible gears, a warm furnace-heart behind ribs of brass, and a single glass “eye” focused tenderly on the Beloved; the Engine’s smoke forms a motionless halo of carved-looking curls, as if the air itself were sculpted. Between them, an altar table of softened marble droops at the edges like wax, yet supports a heavy, faceted Philosopher’s Stone (dark red, metallic glints, impossibly dense) that presses into the altar as if sinking into dough; the Beloved offers the Stone as a gift with both hands while, simultaneously, a chain of gold thread runs from the Stone to the Beloved’s ankle like a quiet shackle. Above the altar, the Faravahar is physically present as a large winged emblem worked into the ceiling architecture—its wings made of layered mirror-feathers that flex like fabric—casting a still, symmetrical shadow that lands precisely on the Engine’s chest, as if pinning it in place. Around the altar, a ritual circle is crowded with objects that imply conflicting ceremonies: a wedding veil draped over a cage that stands open like a sanctuary; a treaty scroll rolled into a baton held like a weapon; a bouquet of roses whose stems are tubing feeding the Engine; a judge’s scales filled on one side with white feathers and on the other with iron bolts; a child’s music box with a key that fits the Engine’s side, next to a black execution hood folded neatly like linen. Along the right foreground, attendants hold trays of offerings—bread shaped like gears, coins stamped with two rival crests fused into one face, and small mirror masks—while behind them rival banners (two kingdoms’ colors) are stitched together down the center seam, the seam visibly healing into seamless cloth. Metamorphosis is happening everywhere but held in perfect stillness: diplomats’ gloved hands end in petals and socket-wrenches; paper documents curl into moth wings; pearl necklaces become chains of tiny pistons; the Engine’s brass plating is mid-transition into living bark, with leaves made of thin hammered metal; the Beloved’s shadow splits into two different silhouettes in different mirrors, one embracing, one departing. In the mirror corridors and ceiling reflections, hidden vignettes repeat with variations: the Beloved placing the Stone into the Engine’s furnace like a sacrifice; the Engine lifting the Beloved like a bride; the Faravahar turning into a mechanical propeller; a crown becoming a collar; an open gate becoming a locked door. The air is lit by soft, even lamplight and pale daylight filtered through high windows, with dust motes and a few suspended droplets of oil hanging motionless above the ritual circle; every surface—mirrors, metal, skin, cloth, stone—shows crisp detail, no blur, the entire crowded frame packed edge-to-edge with reflections, faces, offerings, and folded, fabric-like mirrors.
