Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded from bottom to top: in the foreground on a narrow bridge made of mismatched floorboards and doorframes, a mythic Musician stands center, half-turned as if deciding to step forward or retreat, one hand gripping a worn instrument (violin or lute) and the other hovering over a choice of masks laid out like offerings—porcelain comedy mask, velvet blindfold mask, cracked mirror-mask reflecting a different face; the Musician’s expression is split by a literal half-mask and exposed skin, eyes intent and wary. Each note they play becomes solid matter in midair: glowing musical staffs harden into stair-rails, sharp black notes crystallize into keys and padlocks, warm brass chords inflate into lantern-fish and paper birds, percussion bursts become bricks and confetti, a sustained high note stretches into a tight rope that stitches two rooms together; some formed objects look helpful (bridge supports, bread, bandages), others look dangerous (needles, hooks, chains), all still vibrating. The bridge is a chain of suspended rooms crossing a bottomless void: open rooms hang like a vertical dollhouse—bedroom, chapel, dressing room, tavern, nursery—each room lit with explosive life (hot saturated reds, electric greens, molten gold light) spilling through windows into the dark, while the void below is crowded with drifting furniture, torn curtains, and faint faces embedded in smoke. A towering maypole rises from the bridge’s center and pierces upward through several rooms, its ribbons whipping like living serpents; some ribbons are festive garlands tied to wrists in dancing loops, others are restraints cinched to ankles, chair legs, and a small cage that is lined with pillows like a sanctuary. The all-seeing eye is physically present and unavoidable: a huge iris set into an archway like a stained-glass oculus, blinking slowly; smaller eyes are stitched onto the maypole ribbons, stamped into wax seals on letters, and engraved on keyholes—some eyes are open, some scratched out. A half-burned candle is held close by the Musician, its flame split into two colors; wax drips upward instead of down, forming a second false candle above it, and the rising wax hardens into miniature masks and tiny instruments that cling to the Musician’s sleeve. In the midground, a dressing-room door swings open onto nothing, revealing a crowd of hanging masks that sway like sleeping bats; a mirror on the wall shows the Musician without the instrument, while a nearby window reflection shows them with too many hands. In the background, the suspended rooms grow denser and more precarious: chandeliers bloom with flowers and teeth, curtains billow into sails, sheet music becomes a flock, ribbons from the maypole thread into distant doorways like puppet strings; a celebration table is set with a feast that casts shadows shaped like weapons, and a gift box sits open with a heavy stone inside, labeled with a bright ribbon. Every surface is busy with tangible clues—footprints that lead to a locked door and then continue past it, a ladder that reaches a ceiling painted as a floor, a cracked bell full of fireflies—while the Musician’s solidifying music visibly decides what becomes bridge, what becomes trap, and what becomes disguise.
