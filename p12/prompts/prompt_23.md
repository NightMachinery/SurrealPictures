Vertical 2:3, a tight portrait-like theatrical reveal inside a crowded ice refinery: towering distillation columns made of clear ice merge into living white-barked trees whose frozen roots become pipework, their branches piercing catwalks and growing stained-glass safety wards like leaves—each pane etched with warning runes, numbers, and halo-like hazard icons that cast colored bands across everything. Center stage, a large anthropomorphic bat (fur damp with condensation, wearing a heavy refinery harness and a half-unbuckled respirator) hovers midair with tense, careful posture, extending a “gift” toward a freestanding full-length mirror that stands upright like a person: the mirror has articulated metal arms, a tilt-adjust neck, and a cracked corner arranged like an expressive eye; it leans forward as if deciding, one hand raised in refusal and the other open in longing. The bat’s gift is a wrapped bundle of thick ice tied with ribboned safety tape and a padlock; it is visibly too heavy, dragging a chain that snaps as the bat lets it go—links falling in the foreground beside discarded gloves, shattered goggles, and a brass tag stamped “RETURN,” while a pressure valve behind them exhales a warm plume that parts like curtains to reveal the scene, suggesting a weight just lifted. Inside the ice bundle, through a translucent seam, a small sanctuary-cage is visible: a tiny bed, a candle, and also a set of bars—comfort and confinement in the same box—while a single wing feather is pinned under the lock. The mirror’s surface shows conflicting reflections at once: in one shard the bat appears as a rescuer carrying the gift away; in another the bat looks like it is being gifted to the mirror; in the central pane the mirror reflects an empty space where both should be, as if the decision erases them. A caduceus is physically present as the refinery’s main control lever: two frost-sheathed serpentine pipes coil around a staff-like spindle with small ice wings at the top; the bat’s claw is inches from pulling it, while the mirror’s metal fingers already touch the staff, their grips overlapping like negotiation. The Derafsh Kaviani appears as a grand banner draped from an overhead crane, patched from stained-glass fragments and quilted safety vests, studded with rivets and gemlike bolts; it hangs behind the mirror like a backlit throne cloth, yet its lower edge is caught in rotating gears, slowly being shredded into confetti that floats upward and crystallizes into new glass leaves. The background is dense with ladders, gauges, conveyor belts turned into frozen rivers with fish trapped mid-swim, and icicles shaped like organ pipes; tiny worker silhouettes in the far catwalk shadows hold lanterns that resemble gift boxes, watching as if at a premiere. Foreground puddles of meltwater form mirror-like pools that reflect the caduceus and banner upside down; a bright, clean beam of light from a high stained-glass ward lands on the bat’s loosened harness buckle and the mirror’s open palm, while darker corners hide a second unopened gift identical to the first, tucked under a cot of emergency blankets, waiting.
