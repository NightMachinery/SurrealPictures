Vertical 2:3 frame, slightly low angle from the icy floor up into towering glacier arches forming a crowded amphitheater; the ceiling is alive with a thick aurora that drips downward like liquid ribbons, and each ribbon visibly “rings” as translucent bell-notes that splash into the air (sound behaving like water), while sharp peppermint-colored “cold” leaks from the ice as fragrant smoke that stains nearby objects with taste-colored bruises (scent and flavor behaving like pigment). Center focal protagonist: a timeless Healer in a weathered red cloak whose hem is stitched with tiny bandage-knots and hidden thorns; their face is calm but mischievous, caught mid-choice across repeated time-lapse phases—three to five overlapping versions of the same figure stepping, turning, hesitating, and finally acting—each phase leaving behind a faint afterimage of different expressions (mercy, doubt, delight, regret). In the foreground, the Healer kneels beside a wide bowl carved from glacier glass; they pull a glowing wound-thread from their own palm and trade it into the bowl in exchange for a stranger’s shadow: the bowl accepts pain as a tangible rope and releases a fluttering, warm silhouette that wraps around the stranger like a blanket; nearby, a pile of gifts sits on a scale—one side holds a feather-light cage that looks like a sanctuary (lined with pillows, open door, welcoming lamp), the other side holds a heavy bouquet of keys that looks like a burden (wilting petals, rust, padlocks), both swaying as if deciding who is free. A dharma wheel stands half-buried in ice at center-right like a monument and like a roulette wheel at once; its spokes are made of surgical tools and prayer beads, and it slowly turns, dispensing tiny bandages, coins, and moths into the crowd as if fate is being paid out. A flying kite cuts diagonally through the vertical space from the Healer’s hand up into the aurora: its string is a stitched suture that tugs at different afterimage phases of the Healer, and the kite’s tail is a chain of tiny paper receipts, each receipt labeled only by pictograms (a heart, a scar, a laugh, a tear), implying an ongoing exchange. The amphitheater tiers are packed with figures in winter masks and animal-headed hoods, all leaning forward; some offer jars of captured laughter (visible as fizzing foam), others hold bottles of silence (thick black liquid), and others barter intangible things made physical—memories as snow-globes, promises as padlocked envelopes, apologies as soap bubbles that pop into confetti; mischievous gloved hands reach from the crowd to swap labels, switch contents, and knot kite-strings together. Hidden in shadowed arch niches: small lanterns made from frozen tongues (taste-glow), a row of tiny shoes filled with whisper-smoke, and a cracked mirror that reflects the Healer not as a person but as an empty cloak walking by itself; in another niche, a sleeping patient lies peacefully inside a transparent cage whose bars are made of light, while outside it a predator sits politely wearing a nurse cap, suggesting protection and threat are the same costume. The glacier arches themselves seem to birth and consume the scene: ice teeth curl inward like theater curtains, and from the cracks emerge hands of clear ice offering trade tokens; above, aurora “music” falls as visible droplets that the Healer’s later afterimage phase catches in a cup and pours onto the dharma wheel, making its spin accelerate; scattered across the steps are footprints that move upward in reverse, and a melted pocket watch refreezes mid-drip, implying time is being paid, stolen, and returned. The overall space is dense with floating objects—bandage streamers, kites, tiny wheels, keys, jars, masks—everything mid-action, every exchange ambiguous: healing as theft, sacrifice as prank, generosity as gamble, all under the gleeful, unruly aurora that can be heard with the eyes and tasted with the skin.
