Vertical 2:3 frame, three-quarter viewpoint at human height on the edge of a crowded masked masquerade plaza, deep parallax from an extreme foreground of wet cobblestones (inlaid with tiny repeating footprints in a perfect circle) to a dense background of arcades, balconies, and tightly packed revelers; in the near foreground an exhausted ATHLETE in ceremonial running gear and a cracked porcelain mask kneels beside a spiraling FEAST TABLE that coils like a track around the plaza, the tablecloth stitched from race bibs and funeral veils, its plates arranged in repeating cycles (half-eaten fruit, extinguished candles, fresh bread, ashes, then fruit again), while the athlete’s fingers press a BROKEN CROWN against their chest as if it is both prize and shackle, the crown’s jagged ring leaving a bruise-shaped imprint through fabric; across the table’s widening coils, a towering VOLCANO with a human posture and intent—mantled in dark stone, shoulders rimmed with glowing fissures like slow breathing—stands among dancers, one hand hovering protectively over the banquet, the other hand gripping a transparent WEATHER CAGE: a tall glass reliquary the size of a person, inside which a complete thunderstorm loops in miniature (rain falling upward, lightning striking in silence, a small sun orbiting a hail-cloud), condensation running down the outside as if it is trying to escape; between athlete and volcano, dozens of smaller weather-containers crowd the air and architecture—hurricanes trapped in crystal goblets on the table, snow confined inside hanging birdcages, a rainbow folded and pinned into a lacquered fan, fog bottled in perfume flasks carried by masked guests, a stiff square of blue sky stretched on a frame like laundry—each container labeled with wax seals that match the revelers’ masks; living chandeliers drift overhead like luminous organisms, pulsing and feeding: some sip heat from the volcano’s vents with glass tongues, others drip beads of contained rain onto the feast table in a steady ritual rhythm, and a few have grown roots of light that thread into the cobblestones; a MINOTAUR is physically present but ambiguous: in the midground it appears as a masked host with bull horns pouring wine into an hourglass, in the background as a monumental statue whose labyrinthine shadow spills across the plaza, and in the far foreground as a horned silhouette reflected in a puddle at the athlete’s knee; the ATHLETE’s gaze and the VOLCANO’s gaze miss each other by inches across the coiling table, separated by a taut ribbon of tablecloth that loops repeatedly through hands in the crowd like a communal relay, every loop a near-touch; the crowd is dense and contradictory—some guests toast, some pray, some tie weather-bottles to their wrists like charms, some pry crown-fragments from the gutter—while hidden in the arcade shadows are offerings arranged in circles (tiny crowns, broken medals, bull masks, burnt bread), and at the far end of the plaza a doorway shaped like a mouth opens onto a corridor of repeating banquet tables disappearing into darkness, suggesting the ritual continues elsewhere and returns again.
