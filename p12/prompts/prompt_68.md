Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle close-mid view into a cinder valley packed with smoking glass dunes; the entire scene is built from concentric circles: a charred circular arch in the foreground like an iris, inside it a ring of fused-glass dunes forming a crater, inside that a floating circular pool of mirrored water, inside that the anchor protagonists—two adult twins and a dolphin—locked in a tense, intimate negotiation; the twins stand back-to-back on a blackened pedestal of cooled lava shaped like a trophy base, their feet half-sunk in soft ash, both wearing mismatched laurel wreaths made of tarnished medals and childhood keychains; one twin clutches a wilting bouquet wrapped in old love letters and funeral ribbons, petals falling like burnt confetti onto the ash, the other twin holds an open cage that is lined with pillows and glowing embers, door wide as if offering refuge or imprisonment; between them hovers an anthropomorphized dolphin with alert, humanlike eyes and deliberate posture, its fins strapped into a harness of cracked pearl buttons and pocket-watch chains, presenting a single heavy “gift” (a leaden music box) while its other fin gently blocks the cage door, forcing a choice; behind their heads, the impossible feature dominates: the night sky is descending into the valley in solid layers—constellations peel downward like luminous curtains, a moon sinks like a slow elevator disk, and a ladder of falling stars becomes a staircase that ends at the twins’ pedestal, scattering star-ash that ignites thin smoke trails across the glass dunes; the Cypress of Kashmar rises in the midground as a colossal ancient cypress growing upside-down from the descending sky, its roots braided into a crown above the protagonists, its trunk engraved with tiny scenes (a wedding, a graduation, a farewell, a birth, a trial) that look like different stories depending on where you focus; the dunes are crowded with memory-objects half-buried in ash and reflected in the circular pool: cracked mirrors showing different ages of the twins, a child’s mask beside a judge’s gavel, a lullaby mobile tangled with handcuffs, a toy boat fused to a coffin-shaped jewelry box, a ribboned medal pinned through a photograph, a compass whose needle points to the wilting bouquet; in the deepest background, circular ruins and ring-shaped shadows stack like nested halos, banners of scorched fabric hang in arcs, and distant figures made of smoke and glass watch from within the rings; lighting is a proud, upward-thrusting radiance: a warm, concentrated beam from the descending moon crowns the trio, making their outlines sharp against the darker cinder valley, while cooler starlight spills in circular gradients toward the edges, keeping every layer—foreground arch, crater ring, mirrored pool, protagonists, inverted cypress, descending sky—densely filled and visually contested.
