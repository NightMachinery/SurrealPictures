Vertical 2:3 composition, slightly low-angle view looking up through an endless district made only of staircases, landings, and doorways stacked into dense canyons—no ground level anywhere, only steps disappearing upward and downward into mist. Center frame on a colossal Giant seated on a narrow landing like a throne, calm and unblinking, hands steady, posture devotional; their stillness makes the crowded world feel hushed. From the Giant’s shoulders grow Zahhak’s two living serpents, coiled like ornate epaulets, their mouths close to the Giant’s ears; each serpent is visibly duplicated: two identical bodies occupy the same space a finger-width apart, moving in perfect sync, casting two slightly offset shadows. The Giant’s hunger is gentle but absolute: they slowly lift a stair-step to their lips as if it were bread, and with each bite the missing chunk instantly reappears as a perfect duplicate hovering beside the original—two identical bitten steps, two identical crumbs suspended midair, two identical swallow-motions as a second, matching mouth opens in the air in front of the first and closes at the same time. Behind the Giant, a colossal tidal wave climbs upward through the stair canyons as if the sea has learned architecture; it is frozen in sacred silence, and it too is duplicated: a second identical wave rises from the opposite side, crest meeting crest above the Giant like a vaulted ceiling of water, trapping stairway lanterns, keys, wedding rings, and tiny paper boats inside the glassy blue-green mass. Crowd every edge with contradictions: an open birdcage used as a sanctuary around a sleeping bird; a pantry door labeled like a shrine; a bouquet tied to an ankle like a weight; a cradle hanging from a railing like a prison; overflowing banquet platters on steps that lead nowhere; a “Do Not Enter” sign nailed to an inviting doorway; kneeling figures who look like pilgrims, gamblers, and mourners all at once, some of them duplicated in pairs with the same face but different intentions. In the foreground, steps are engraved with small mouths that never speak; silent bells hang from banisters and do not sway; candles burn without flicker; dust motes hang motionless in warm amber light, as if time itself has been told to be reverent. Hidden in shadowed stairwells: duplicated footprints that stop mid-step, duplicated keys that fit no lock, and a duplicate silhouette of the Giant that faces the wrong direction.
