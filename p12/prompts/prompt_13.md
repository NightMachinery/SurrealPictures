Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded foreground-to-background: at the center of a rotating ring-city made of stacked streets and bridges, gravity lanes visibly twist like luminous conveyor-belts so crowds walk sideways, upside-down, and diagonally across facades; in the main foreground stands the Trickster—an androgynous, mythic figure with mismatched gloves and a half-smile—one hand offering a gift-wrapped box while the other secretly unthreads its ribbon into a snare, eyes split between tenderness and mischief. The “gift” is physically impossible: the box is open yet sealed, and its interior is a small, complete room that spills outward into the city—bed, doorway, and window floating midair—so that people step into it and emerge from different streets above; the box’s paper is heavy like lead sheets, dragging chains that look like celebratory streamers. From the gift-room’s window grows the First Blossom: a single fresh flower on a branch of bare winter wood, its petals glowing with dew; the blossom’s shadow falls onto a nearby wall as a different flower entirely, suggesting another season. Beside the Trickster, a Sword in the Stone is embedded not in rock but in a chunk of city pavement that orbits them like a moon; the stone rotates slowly, and the sword’s blade points in contradictory directions at once (its tip seen both upward and downward along different gravity lanes), while tiny citizens kneel to it as if it’s a monument and others use it as a handrail to cross a gap. The Trickster loops the gift’s ribbon around the sword hilt like a bow, as if presenting it, yet their foot quietly nudges the stone away from anyone who reaches. Hanging above their shoulders is an enormous Hourglass with clear glass and pale sand—but the sand rises, pauses, and then pours sideways into the city’s gutters where it becomes streetlight dust; inside the hourglass, a miniature version of the Trickster climbs the glass as if escaping time. Midground: dense market stalls cling to walls and ceilings; vendors sell lanterns shaped like teeth, keys shaped like petals, and masks shaped like hands; a caged birdcage sits open and empty while a safe sits open and full of feathers; a child in a helmet floats, tethered to a balloon that is actually a small anchor; a couple dances in a gravity lane like a river, their footsteps leaving temporary chalk constellations. Background: the ring-city curves upward into itself, packed with windows, clotheslines, and staircases that lead into doors on the underside of bridges; trains run along vertical rails; a distant cathedral-like structure is built from stacked gift boxes, each tied with ribbons that become the city’s roads. Overhead, the sky is not open air but the inner surface of the ring, covered in murals that peel off and drift as real paper birds; light sources are scattered everywhere—prismatic streetlamps, glowing vending machines, and the hourglass dust—casting crisp, playful beams and long, overlapping shadows that hide small secrets: a hand offering coins that are actually seeds, a pickpocket returning a wallet into a nest, and a cracked stone under the sword leaking honey instead of water. The Trickster hesitates mid-gesture as if deciding whether this generosity is rescue or trap, while the city itself seems to rotate around the offered gift, swallowing it and birthing it at the same time.
