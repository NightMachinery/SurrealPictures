Vertical 2:3 frame, straight-on view of a crowded astronomy school interior split exactly into mirrored upper and lower worlds: the lower classroom has tiled floor, desks, chalkboards packed with star calculations, brass orreries, telescopes, hanging astrolabes; the upper world is the same room inverted like a ceiling-reflection, with objects hovering and shadows pointing upward. At the center seam sits a tall doorway that is also a threshold line, its frame formed by the living Cypress of Kashmar growing through it—roots gripping the lower floor, branches threading the upper “ceiling,” needles arranged like a star chart; the bark is carved with lesson notes and names like vows. In the foreground, the Host (calm, watchful) stands on the lower side offering a tray of tiny toys to unseen “guests”: a tin planet set, a wind-up comet, a dollhouse classroom, a toy telescope; a friendship bracelet is tied around the Host’s wrist and also looped around the door handle like a pledge. Opposite, the Trickster (serene smile, intent eyes) leans from the upper side, gently undoing the threshold: the toys transmute midair into full-scale objects—tin planets swell into heavy floating spheres with chalk-dust rings, the toy telescope becomes a real telescope aimed through the doorway, the dollhouse unfolds into a second door that opens onto the first. A half-burned candle drifts at the seam; its wax runs upward and downward at once, hardening into tiny stair-constellations that both invite and trap. Around them: students suspended in impossible calm, a birdcage used as a lectern with its door open, gifts tied to ankles like ballast, paper star maps fluttering like moths, and a quiet, pale dawn light filling every corner without a single empty horizon.
