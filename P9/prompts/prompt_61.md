Vertical 2:3 illustration, a monastic scriptorium seen on a steeply tilting horizon as if the entire room is slowly capsizing; the frame is crowded edge-to-edge with desks, lecterns, chained manuscripts, wax-dripping candles, reliquaries, and tangled curtains of vellum, while “living ink” leaks from quills and margins, crawling like veins across wood and stone, forming calligraphic tendrils that braid around ankles, climb pillars, and bloom into half-legible prayers. At the center, the Celebrant stands on a low dais made of stacked blank pages—mythic, timeless, neither young nor old—barefoot, skin dusted with pale ash like powdered chalk, wearing an open ceremonial stole that resembles an unpainted baptismal cloth; their posture is both offering and containment: one hand lifted as if blessing, the other pressed gently to their own sternum as if keeping something inside from leaving. The theme of innocence/purity is everywhere but uneasy: untouched white vellum glows like fresh snow, a bowl of clear water reflects a face that isn’t there, milk-white wax runs upward against gravity, and a thin halo of clean light surrounds the Celebrant while the rest of the room is warm and intimate—candle-amber shadows, close air, quiet breath—like a private confession shared at whisper distance. The impossible, defining break in physics is an invisible presence physically occupying the scene: a second “person” is unmistakably there but unseen—cushions dimple under absent weight, a chair rocks in midair, a necklace lifts and tightens around nothing, fingers made only of pressure indent the Celebrant’s throat lightly without harm, and ink-splashes freeze mid-flight in the exact arc of a body turning, outlining a negative silhouette by the way dust and floating parchment scraps refuse to enter it. Suspended debris flows through the slanted room like a paused current—feathers, torn illuminated initials, rosary beads, fragments of dried roses, tiny glass shards, and ink droplets—each with faint sequential echoes (multiple positions of the same object a heartbeat apart) to encode time without motion. The Simurgh appears ambiguously in three places at once: as an illuminated marginal creature taking flight from a manuscript, as a chandelier of interlocked quills and feathers whose shadow becomes a vast bird, and as living ink briefly assembling into wings that shelter the Celebrant and the invisible figure simultaneously. A friendship bracelet—frayed threads, childish knots, sun-faded colors—binds the Celebrant’s wrist to a chain that disappears into the negative-space body, and the same bracelet reappears tied around the jaw of a skull on the nearest desk, the skull filled with pooled ink that mirrors a tender scene that may be memory or invention. Foreground: a close desk cluttered with a skull, the bracelet, a half-written vow, and an open palm print in wet ink that clearly belongs to no visible hand; midground: the Celebrant and the palpable, unseen companion in near-embrace without contact; background: rows of monks’ hoods hanging empty like shed skins, book spines breathing ink-smoke, and a distant doorway that opens onto pure white light that feels less like salvation than erasure—every corner containing a small, interpretable mystery, nothing left empty, the whole image a frozen intimacy with an absent partner that could be protection, haunting, desire, grief, or grace.
