Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded marble nursery that feels both womb and mausoleum: polished white stone cribs, bassinets, and rocking horses carved like reliquaries; every surface is etched with faint fingerprints, half-erased lullaby lyrics, and cameo-reliefs of faces that don’t match—memory layered over memory. Centered and monumental, a mythic Giant sits wedged into the room as if the architecture grew around them: knees drawn up, torso slightly twisted, one bare shoulder exposed under a too-small ceremonial nursery garment (part swaddling cloth, part regalia), skin like warm marble shot through with hairline veins of gold; their expression is rapturous and wrecked, as if struck by blinding joy and an old wound at the same time. In their lap, they cradle a small lighthouse the way one would hold a sleeping child—its lantern is lit, but instead of flame it projects spinning, miniature “rooms” of the nursery itself, like nostalgic dioramas; the beam paints the Giant’s hands with shifting afterimages of earlier embraces. The defining impossibility dominates the scene: the Giant’s arms are wrapped tightly around a full human-sized *absence*—an invisible presence that bends reality—cloth pulls taut around empty shoulders, a crib mattress caves in under unseen weight, a cascade of marbles hangs midair as if stopped by an invisible body, and a second set of wet footprints appears in marble dust leading directly into the Giant’s embrace and then vanishing. Above and behind, an aurora borealis is physically inside the nursery, threaded through ceiling arches like living silk curtains; it spills ecstatic, prismatic light that overexposes highlights on marble cheeks and makes the statues “breathe,” their eyes half-opening—some infant statues reaching outward, some adult statues recoiling, some smiling with terror. Fill every corner with tactile clues and contradictions: broken toys repaired with surgical sutures, a pacifier hanging on a rosary, a wedding veil pinned to a cribpost, a tarnished hand mirror reflecting a face that isn’t there, floating petals and chalky dust frozen mid-sparkle, tiny cherub statues carrying heavy keys, and a mobile made of miniature lighthouses circling an empty center. The atmosphere is euphoric to the point of pain—radiant glare, ecstatic color spill, laughter implied in the light itself—yet the scene reads like a memory you can’t prove happened, a joyous reunion with someone only the room can still feel.
