Vertical 2:3 frame, deep-focus “frozen moment” in a sky-reef: dozens of drifting stone islands packed tightly together like coral heads in midair, their undersides bristling with roots, ropes, chandeliers, shells, staircases, and hanging rooms, with no empty horizon—only layers of floating debris (petals, crumbs, cutlery, moth wings, hairpins, beads, tiny bones, playing marbles, seeds) suspended as if time stopped mid-sigh. In the center foreground on the nearest island stands **The Swarm**: a mythic, androgynous adult figure tall and weighty, half-nude yet not eroticized, skin luminous and vulnerable, draped in a living mantle of innumerable small bodies that read ambiguously as bees/moths/miniature masked people/ink-black birds—each clinging, feeding, nesting, or whispering; the “cloak” leaks from their ribs and throat like breath made visible. Their posture is both regal and starving: one hand gently offering, one hand grasping, shoulders slightly hunched as if bearing a secret appetite; their face calm with childlike wonder, eyes wide as if discovering something tender for the first time. From each shoulder grows a **serpent** (Zahhak’s shoulder serpents): not simply reptiles but intimate companions—one coils forward to “taste” the air with a forked tongue, the other loops behind the neck like a stole, their mouths poised near the figure’s ears as if advising, consoling, or demanding; their scales catch the light like wet porcelain, and their expressions feel strangely human.

A **feast table** occupies the mid-foreground, but it is **object-personified** in a bold, impossible way: the table is also a reclining human form—polished wood bending into ribcage and hip, table legs becoming shins and feet, a linen cloth turning into pale skin that wrinkles with gooseflesh; place settings behave like a crowded family of silent guests. Platters become faces; goblets become throats; forks curl like fingers; a tureen opens like a yawning mouth; a loaf of bread shows faint bite-marks arranged like a smile; grapes resemble tiny lungs; oysters look like eyelids. The table-body reaches toward the Swarm as if begging to be fed, while simultaneously offering abundance—an endless paradox of hunger and giving. The Swarm’s outstretched hand hovers above the “table-person’s” chest, holding a **wilting bouquet**: lush flowers drooping as if exhausted, petals bruised and shedding, stems tied with a ribbon that looks like a vein; a few blossoms remain defiantly radiant, and their falling petals turn into small moths midair, joining the cloak.

Crowd the corners with visual riddles: a child’s wind-up toy half-buried in fruit peels; a cracked mirror reflecting a different island; a stack of empty plates that casts the shadow of a tower; a fishbowl floating without water containing a single candle; a tiny doorway in a stone that opens onto another feast; a chandelier whose crystals are teeth; a chair that looks like it has knees drawn to its chest; scattered love letters with no readable text, only the impression of handwriting; a pair of gloves posed like hands mid-apology. Background islands are dense with repeating variations of the same totems—miniature banquet scenes, bouquets in different stages of decay, shoulder-serpent silhouettes carved into rock—suggesting a cycle rather than a story. Lighting and color evoke **wonder and discovery**: warm dawn-gold mixed with soft iridescent blues and pinks, like sunlight refracting through soap film; gentle halos around floating dust and pollen; bioluminescent flecks within the Swarm’s living mantle; everything sharp, textured, and tactile. The entire scene should feel tender and unsettling at once—ecstatic abundance and quiet dread in the same breath—an image that asks “what is being desired, and who is consuming whom?” with no single answer. No text, no empty sky, no single clear narrative—only a crowded, emotionally intelligent puzzle.
