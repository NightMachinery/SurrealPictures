Vertical 2:3 frame, densely packed cathedral-kitchen interior under ribbed vaults and stained-glass windows, every surface alive with utensils, tiles, talismans, hanging herbs, wet bread, pomegranates, bandages, sweat-sheened fingerprints, drifting flour and ember-ash like snow; at the center stands a mythic “friend-athlete” (timeless, intimate, physically present)—a powerful runner’s body paused mid-motion as if caught at the peak of a breath after a sprint, one knee slightly lifted as though stepping onto an unseen threshold, bare feet on mosaic, torso partly nude under a jewel-weighted apron made from the Derafsh Kaviani (lion-and-sun banner rendered as cloth and metalwork, tassels and gemstones catching firelight), shoulders marked with faint tape-lines and bruises that read as both training and tenderness; their face is gentle and exhausted, eyes focused downward with quiet care, as they cradle a small hearth-flame in their hands the way one would hold a living animal or an infant—yet the flame is also a miniature oven-mouth, and inside it is the entire cathedral kitchen again, perfectly visible, repeating inward in infinite nested containment (kitchen within flame within oven within kitchen…), each recursion showing the same athlete-friend holding the same impossible fire, shrinking forever; around them, ovens embedded in the stone glow like planets—spherical furnace-cores with molten atmospheres and orbiting iron rings, casting explosive vitality through the room: reds, golds, verdant greens from stained glass, and sharp electric highlights that make everything feel hyper-alive and on the verge of bursting; the environment responds to care: cracked bowls mended with golden seams, knives wrapped like wounds, loaves stitched with thread, a kettle being gently “bandaged” by floating strips of linen, steam shaped like protective hands, while sparks arrange themselves into brief halo-like patterns that instantly dissolve; collage layout and flattened planes: tiled borders, inset panels like a diptych of countertop close-ups (salt crystals, pulse in a wrist, a needle passing through dough), stacked poster-like layers of arches and shelves that deliberately break perspective; in the negative spaces between hanging ladles, banner folds, and rising steam, a secondary figure appears only as an illusion—a full-body silhouette that could be a lover, a child, a ghost, or the athlete’s own missing self—formed by absence rather than ink, changing depending on where the eye rests; corners crowded with clues that refuse a single story: a medal melted into a spoon, a prayer-book used as a cutting board, a shoeprint stamped in ash beside a tenderly folded towel, tiny birds made of charred pastry hovering mid-flap, and shards of mirror reflecting different recursions of the same flame; everything frozen at the instant before something happens—comfort, confession, rescue, or rupture—so the scene feels like a remembered dream that insists it was once yours.
