Vertical 2:3 illustration, a packed courtroom amphitheater that has become a ceremonial kitchen-infirmary: concentric stone tiers draped in heavy embroidered tapestries and judge’s banners, but everything behaves like *soft sculpture*—columns slump like warm wax, the witness stand sags like a velvet mattress, marble railings droop like fondant, the judge’s bench curls like a ribbon, the floor tiles wrinkle as if sewn leather; frozen mid-event as if time stopped during an impossible exchange. At the center on a raised dais stands a mythic healer-chef, adult and timeless, androgynous, barefoot on a cutting-board altar that is also an operating table; one half of their attire a crisp chef’s coat with stained cuffs, the other half layered healer’s wraps and ceremonial sash, partly loosened to reveal vulnerable skin marked with delicate stitch-like embroidery and faint bruised halos (sensual, classical, non-explicit), posture both offering and resisting—chin lifted, shoulders heavy, hands steady, eyes unfocused as if listening to a verdict that is also a prayer. In their left hand: the Lyre of Orpheus, held like a surgical instrument and a serving tool at once; its frame is bone-and-wood, its strings are taut threads that read simultaneously as harp strings, sutures, and pasta strands, with tiny charms (teeth, pearl buttons, seed pods, court seals) tied along them; several strings are mid-pluck, but the vibration is suspended as visible ripples in the air. In their right hand: a shallow bowl/scale-pan held out to the crowd; inside it, a tender “sacrifice/exchange” still-life where meanings collide—pomegranate arils mixed with small coins, a folded verdict paper steeping like tea, a bandage ribbon knotted into a bow beside a wedding ring, a salt pile shaped like a miniature heart, a single tear captured in a spoon like mercury; their own shadow peels off their feet and curls upward as a dark ingredient being portioned, as if the price is internal. The Cypress of Kashmar rises through the center of the courtroom floor like a sacred pillar-tree, bark etched with courtroom filigree and kitchen tally marks; its branches form a canopy of scales-of-justice silhouettes and ladle-like boughs, while roots thread into the soft stone like veins—some roots end in tiny doors, others in IV drip bulbs that dispense saffron-colored light; cypress leaves shed not needles but thin parchment slivers stamped with mute symbols (no readable text). The amphitheater is crowded: jurors in mismatched masks and flour-dusted wigs, witnesses holding covered platters like evidence, patients wrapped in legal scrolls, a bailiff with a clownish seriousness balancing a gavel that is inexplicably plush; animal-headed figures in formal collars lean forward; a pair of cherub-like orderlies carry a tray of glowing stitches; several spectators are mannequin-still while others are caught mid-gasp, mid-laugh, mid-sob—each face ambiguous enough to read as longing or judgment. Foreground clutter: scattered utensils that double as medical tools (a whisk shaped like a ribcage, a scalpel with a pastry handle), cracked porcelain evidence tags, spilled spices forming constellations, a small mirror reflecting the healer-chef’s hands but not their body, and a toppled hourglass whose “sand” is poppy seeds floating in place. Midair debris everywhere—confetti that is actually dried petals, courtroom dust that is powdered sugar, tiny moths shaped like wax seals, droplets of broth suspended like planets—each corner contains a micro-paradox (a spoon cradling a heartbeat; a verdict stamp pressed into dough that becomes skin; a curtain tapestry melting into a pair of clasped hands and then back into fabric). Lighting and color feel whimsically absurd yet emotionally loaded: carnival-bright stained-glass beams (mint, marigold, rose, cobalt) cut through incense-steam, casting playful candy hues over solemn faces; shadows are soft and plush, highlights glint on coins and tears; everything dense, ornate, and claustrophobically full, no empty horizons, no clear “story”—only a single frozen, crowded moment where cooking, healing, judging, and paying are the same act, inviting contradictory interpretations.
