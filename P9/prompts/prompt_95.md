Vertical 2:3 frame, an opulent yet ruinous banquet hall that reads like a chapel: crowded from edge to edge with offerings, debris, and drifting fragments, no empty space. In the absolute stillness of the foreground, a timeless oracle stands (androgynous, adult, mythic presence), barefoot on a table set for Thanksgiving, posture calm and heavy as if carved from living flesh; their skin partly draped in ceremonial cloth and partly bare, marked by faint gold leaf scars and pressure imprints from vanished jewelry. They cradle a tall, oval mirror against their sternum like a sacred icon; the mirror is not reflective glass but a depthless black water that “remembers.” Around their head, a broken crown is worn like a halo—cracked, missing teeth, with shards hovering just off the skin as if held by breath; other crown pieces lie among the dishes like reliquaries. Perched within the architecture above and behind them is the Simurgh made physical as an impossible fusion of bird and sanctuary: wings spanning the rafters like stained-glass feathers, eyes like lanterns, tail plumes cascading into the room as falling leaves, ash, and peacock-metal fragments, simultaneously protective and judgmental. The theme of gratitude is embodied as a chain of giving and receiving: dozens of hands (some human, some sculpted from bread, wood, porcelain, candlewax) extend from platters, tureens, gourds, and folded napkins—offering, accepting, hesitating—each gesture frozen mid-transaction, tender and unsettling. Object personification dominates: pumpkins with closed eyelids exhale steam shaped like sighs; cutlery bends into kneeling figures; wine in overturned goblets forms half-formed faces; a roasted bird becomes a sleeping body with a heartbeat implied by a single suspended droplet of gravy; prayer beads made of cranberries coil like vertebrae. Memory projection is overt: from the oracle’s mirror spill translucent vignettes that cling to objects—tiny scenes of embraces, departures, apologies, and private ecstasies—projected onto plates, skin, feathers, and shattered crown metal, as if every item is forced to wear someone else’s recollection; the projections contradict each other in mood (tenderness beside shame, reverence beside dread) and never resolve into one story. Foreground remains reverent and silent: the oracle’s gaze meets the viewer as if blessing and accusing at once, their shadow split into two different silhouettes that do not match their body. Behind them, the background erupts into kinetic chaos held perfectly still: a long table recedes into a storm of levitating dishes, torn velvet, fluttering receipts and gratitude letters with no legible words, swarms of feathers, spilled salt forming constellations, and guests implied only by blurred torsos and masks caught mid-turn, as though time shattered but sound was removed. Lighting feels sacred—warm amber candlelight pooling around offerings, cut by cold, moonlit shafts from high windows—so the whole scene reads like a silent rite in which thanks, debt, and longing are indistinguishable. No clear narrative, only dense clues; every corner contains a secondary tableau, mirrored pairs, and contradictions, inviting multiple incompatible interpretations.
