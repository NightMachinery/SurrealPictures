A gilded cathedral-nave banquet hall seen front-on like a ritual stage: endless tables run toward an ornate apse, every surface crowded with plates, fruit, candles, torn lace, wax seals, keys, rosary-like gears, scattered letters, and censored scraps; silverware and goblets float midair in a frozen burst, rotating like a constellation of knives and spoons that resemble migrating birds. At the center stands the Clockmaker—mythic, exhausted, tender—an androgynous elder with ink-stained fingers, a heavy apron over half-unfastened ceremonial garments (tasteful partial nudity with classical restraint), posture bowed as if listening to a heartbeat inside the room; one hand delicately cups a small open music box whose mechanism is impossible: its ballerina is absent, replaced by a tiny, living clockwork heart that turns the cylinder, and each note manifests as visible threads. The other hand reaches toward a hovering fork with the intimacy of a lover touching a cheek—yet the air bristles with taboo: mouths stitched onto napkins, a velvet blindfold on a chalice, a locked book chained to the table, a ring of red thread binding wrists painted on the tablecloth, warning seals stamped on fruit skins, a confession booth door ajar in the background with no interior. The Faravahar is physically present as a luminous architectural totem: a stained-metal and mother-of-pearl Faravahar embedded above the apse like a hovering emblem/halo, its wings shedding fine gold dust that falls upward; the Clockmaker’s shadow aligns with it imperfectly, suggesting either blessing or accusation. Emotional weather breaks physics loudly: tenderness falls through the hall as warm, slow “rain” made of translucent petals and salt crystals; where it touches objects, matter transmutates—wine in glasses becomes liquid mercury, crumbs become pearls, tarnished silver blooms into soft skin-like porcelain, candle smoke condenses into vellum pages mid-flight—yet everything is paused at the instant of change, suspended droplets and half-changed surfaces sharply readable. Lighting feels like gentle love under a secret: honeyed candlelight and dawn-rose illumination from the apse, soft shadows, glints on metal, a faint blush in skin and gold, but with an undertone of quiet dread in the darker corners. Collage the space into stacked planes with a vintage tarot-card frame and crowded margins: ornate border packed with tiny vignette tiles (hands offering/withdrawing, clocks with missing numbers, eyes reflected in spoons, a bird carrying a key, a sewn veil, a bitten pomegranate, a small door, a cracked mirror, a locket, an hourglass leaking feathers), a blank title plaque, subtle numbering, and mosaic insets that echo the central scene from contradictory angles; no empty background anywhere—foreground debris, midair dust, floating utensils, torn fabric, gears, petals, and notes fill every corner; the image should feel like one frozen, impossible moment that could mean tenderness, shame, ecstasy, grief, or salvation depending on the viewer.
