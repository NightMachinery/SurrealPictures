Vertical 2:3 frame, a monumental library-cum-shrine interior seen in three deep planes: in the foreground, scattered vellum pages, broken rosary-beads of pearls, and a shallow pool of spilled milk that reflects a sky that isn’t there; within the milky reflection drift tiny feathers, ash, and unreadable constellations. Center-midground, the Librarian-Idol advances one step forward with fearless calm—tall, androgynous adult presence on a low dais of stacked books like an altar, posture upright yet tender, chin slightly lifted as if accepting a verdict; their body is partly revealed beneath a heavy ceremonial librarian mantle (frayed catalog cards stitched into the hem, gold thread like halo-rings), skin marked with faint stamped due-dates like bruises, hands steady. In one hand, an open music box integrated into a book’s spine: its mechanism exposed like a delicate ribcage, ballerina replaced by a small faceless marble child-figure made of wax, mid-turn, frozen; its “music” visualized as thin ribbon-like paper strips spiraling into the air, each strip carrying blank staff lines. In the other hand, an hourglass whose glass is cracked yet unspilling: instead of sand, a contained thunderstorm churns inside—miniature lightning, rain, and snow all trapped in the hourglass chambers, suspended mid-fall, droplets and flakes hanging as if pinned by gravity that forgot how to finish. The broken physics is everywhere: weather is contained in objects and architecture—an entire cumulonimbus sealed inside a floating glass cube near the ceiling; a narrow beam of sun trapped in a jar on a shelf; a spiral of wind confined within a rolled parchment that lifts hair and pages without moving them; rain gathered into crystalline beads orbiting a reading lamp. The theme of innocence/purity is present but compromised and radiant: a white gown (possibly the Idol’s, possibly an abandoned cover) hangs immaculate over a chair yet is slowly dissolving into moths; a baptismal font made from a filing cabinet overflows with clear water that refuses to touch the ground, levitating in a perfect sphere around a single pale lily; doves appear carved from salt, some melting, some intact, all staring. Near the Idol’s feet, a poisoned apple sits on a catalog tray like an offering—skin glossy, too perfect, split by one precise bite that reveals not flesh but dark ink and a sleeping eye; a thin thread of ink rises from it and stitches itself into the air like a seam closing a wound. Background: towering shelves bend into impossible arches like a cathedral, with niches holding reliquaries of mundane objects (keys, combs, teeth, rings) labeled with tags that are blank; distant silhouettes of readers are present only as coats draped over chairs, implying absence; a large window shows a serene dawn sky, yet that same dawn is also trapped inside the hourglass and reflected in the milk pool, creating conflicting times. Lighting/color: courageous, forward-driving illumination—warm sunrise cutting through cool storm-tones, sharp rim light outlining the advancing figure, dust motes like sparks, chiaroscuro that feels like stepping into truth. Fill every corner with small, decipherable-but-ambiguous details: floating index cards like snow, a ladder that climbs into a cloud-in-a-cage, a cracked mirror fragment reflecting a different face for the Idol, wax seals drifting like petals, tiny hourglasses embedded in book spines, raindrops caught on invisible threads; everything frozen mid-event, exquisitely detailed, emotionally tense, no readable text, no captions, no watermark.
