A tall vertical frame (2:3) inside an immense hall of ancestral masks where every surface is crowded: thousands of carved faces stacked floor-to-vault like an ossuary of identities, some weeping resin, some smiling, some cracked; the frescoes are alive—cheeks subtly inflate, painted lips part to breathe, ribs and lungs ripple beneath plaster—while dust, petals, ash, and tiny bright fragments hang motionless in the air as if time has stopped mid-exhale. At the center stands a mythic Elder (ageless-yet-ancient, weathered skin mapped with healed scars and gold-seamed fissures, ambiguous gender, regal posture but exhausted shoulders), barefoot on a mosaic that resembles both a hospital tile floor and a sacred map; their expression is ecstatic but not simple joy—bliss laced with grief and relief. They hold a single shared cup with two sets of handles (meant for multiple hands at once), and several unseen hands—some youthful, some skeletal, some masked, some made of paint—reach from the crowded margins to touch it without fully possessing it; the cup’s surface reflects not the room but a calm sea of bandages unfurling into flowering vines. A skull is present yet tenderly repurposed: half-mask, half-reliquary, nestled against the Elder’s sternum like a sleeping animal, its empty eye sockets filled with small luminous seeds; its teeth are threaded with a fine red ribbon that leads into the walls and stitches cracks closed. The Derafsh Kaviani is physically present as a heavy, jewel-studded standard unfurling behind the Elder, but it is fragmented by impossible physics—its cloth has shattered into many suspended panels of embroidered velvet that orbit like broken stained-glass, each shard showing a different partial emblem, each edge fraying into light; the standard’s pole splits into multiple aligned segments hovering centimeters apart, held together only by thin filaments of glowing breath drifting from the frescoes. Fragmentation is the defining phenomenon everywhere: columns separated into floating slices, mask faces cleaved into layered wafers, the Elder’s own silhouette subtly offset into overlapping “afterimages” that do not blur but stack like cut paper—yet the scene reads as healing/recovery because every fracture is actively mending: cracks pull toward each other, shards are being sutured by threads, gold lacquer flows uphill into seams, and the air itself seems to administer care. In the corners and along the floor, add dense secondary riddles: discarded crutches that sprout feathers, an overturned bowl of pearls that are actually tiny molars, mirrors reflecting different ages of the Elder, incense smoke forming anatomies, small figures wrapped in gauze climbing into a mask’s mouth like a doorway, and a quiet pool of water that shows the hall intact while the real hall remains broken. Lighting and color should feel like transcendent ecstasy—radiant warm gold and opalescent highlights against deep velvets and bruised shadows—so the entire frozen moment looks like a sacred medical miracle paused mid-procedure; no text, no symbols written as words, no empty negative space anywhere.
