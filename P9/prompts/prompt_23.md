Vertical 2:3 frame, no empty sky, every corner busy: inside a vast clockwork foundry-cathedral where giant gears, pistons, and crucibles interlock with an impossible network of silk conveyor belts that snake like pale rivers through the scene, carrying mismatched offerings—crowns, teeth, hourglasses, wedding rings, keys, cut fruit, cracked mirrors, small bones, sealed letters with no legible writing—toward furnaces that glow like a sunrise from below. At center stands the Vizier, mythic and ageless, gender-ambiguous, barefoot on a dais of intermeshed watch-escapements; their posture is calm, upright, victorious, one hand raised as if blessing a transaction, the other holding a wilting bouquet whose petals visibly “spend” themselves into metal—each falling petal becomes a coin, a gear tooth, or a tiny beating heart before it hits the ground. The Vizier’s garments are ceremonial and heavy: layered veils and jeweled collars that look like court regalia but also like protective foundry gear; parts of the body are classically nude in a vulnerable way (bare shoulders, ribs, hip), skin catching the warm triumphant light, while fine chains and filigree restraints suggest both authority and surrender. The theme of sacrifice/exchange is everywhere: masked workers and elegant nude figures in the foreground trade intangibles as tangible objects—one person offers a shadow folded neatly like cloth and receives a glowing ribcage-lantern; another places their reflection onto the silk belt like a sheet of glass and takes away a new face; a hand pours tears into a mold and lifts out a perfect key; a tongue-shaped ladle tastes molten gold and produces a flock of porcelain birds. The defining broken logic is loud, explicit sensory synesthesia: sound is visible as colored glyph-like pressure waves (not readable text) erupting from hammers and chiming gears; the scent of hot metal and flowers rises as translucent, ribboning “perfume-smoke” that braids into the rafters; warmth becomes a shimmering cloth draped over figures; bitterness and sweetness appear as crystalline shapes falling like snow; the silk belts themselves “sing,” and their notes become physical threads weaving through machinery. In the midground, the Tower of Babel appears as a colossal spiraling assembly-tower/smokestack built from stacked molds, ladders, and cast reliefs of mouths and ears—crowded with tiny figures climbing, bargaining, kissing foreheads, pushing burdens upward—its upper tiers dissolving into a blizzard of brass confetti and sparks, frozen mid-explosion. In the background, the Cypress of Kashmar grows impossibly through the foundry floor: a towering living cypress whose trunk transitions into bronze and clockwork, roots gripping cracked marble and iron, branches bearing lantern-like seedpods and small censers; some limbs are grafted into pulleys and beltways, as if the tree itself is part of the machine’s economy. The overall lighting reads as triumph—radiant golds, celebratory glare, prismatic highlights, sparks like victory confetti—yet faces and gestures remain ambiguous (half-hidden eyes, mirrored masks, tender hands on throats, clenched jaws), freezing the moment at the exact instant an exchange becomes irreversible; pack the air with drifting ash, petal-dust, hair-thin threads of silk, floating tool fragments, and tiny suspended droplets of molten metal that refract miniature versions of the scene. Avoid any clear story resolution: make every object feel symbolic and double-edged, every touch both intimate and transactional, every victory both earned and paid for.
