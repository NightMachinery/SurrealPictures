Vertical 2:3 frame, deep focus and crowded with detail: inside a vast legal archive that feels like a cathedral built from filing cabinets, rolling ladders, docket boxes, stamped folders, and shelves that vanish upward into haze; between the aisles runs a narrow canal of black ink and melted sealing wax, reflecting light like obsidian. A mythic ferryman kneels in the canal, impossibly colossal—shoulders brushing mezzanine railings, knees wedged between cabinets, breath fogging the air—yet their expression is gentle, relieved, exhausted in the way someone looks after surviving something; their body bears healed seams like sutures made of fine redacted lines, with parchment bandages loosening and drifting away. The vessel is a hybrid of courthouse matter and pilgrimage boat: a long skiff stitched from ledger spines and drawer fronts, its ribs made of brass staples, its prow a broken gavel, its wake turning ember-glowing documents into cool blank pages as it passes (recovery as a physical aftereffect). Papers, affidavits, photographs, and thin ribbons of transcript hang frozen mid-fall throughout the space like snow caught in time; every sheet glows at the edges like embers without burning, shedding sparks that become tiny moths and ash that becomes pollen. The ferryman’s nearest hand is prominently open—palm toward the viewer, enormous, intimate, simultaneously blessing and surrender—its lifelines mapped like court diagrams; from that open hand spills a small cascade of cooled wax seals that transform into pearls and then into teeth and then back into seals, never settling on one reading. Lashed to their oar (or used as the oar itself) is the Derafsh Kaviani: a legendary banner reimagined as a heavy standard sewn from torn verdict pages, hammered coins, and colored cords, hovering with impossible weightlessness despite the stillness; its tassels are made of broken handcuffs and braided hair, and its shadow resembles wings, a shroud, or a doorway depending on where you look. Populate the corners with ambiguous human traces—half-seen clerks made of smoke, a blindfolded statue’s cracked face in a drawer, an empty witness chair floating upside down, an IV drip made of redacted paper feeding clear water into the ink-canal, a keyring of tiny scales, a heart-shaped stamp pad, paper fish swimming through air—nothing resolves into a single story. Lighting should feel like relief: a soft, warm dawn filtering through high archive windows, mixing with ember-glow from the documents, lifting the scene as if a weight has just been removed; the entire moment is a “paused” rescue in mid-action, sensual but tender, unsettling but consoling, with scale and meaning constantly contradicting themselves.
