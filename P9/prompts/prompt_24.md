Ultra-wide, curving-edge viewpoint from knee-height inside a crowded lantern-lit courtyard that feels half temple, half street festival, half interior of a body: in the center, a mythic beast (massive, timeworn, neither fully animal nor human—lion shoulders, ox ribs, human hands scarred like old marble) kneels as if mid-confession, while two identical adult twins are fused with it in an impossible union—one twin emerging from the beast’s open ribcage like a second self being born, the other twin sinking back into its shadow as if being forgiven; their spines braid together into a single column of vertebrae that continues upward into architecture, becoming a pillar that holds the sky. The defining broken physics is literal metaphor made physical: “gratitude” is visible as overflowing thanks—countless translucent hands and handwritten thank-you notes (in many languages, some illegible) pour out of the beast’s throat like a warm, luminous tide, freezing mid-air into a river of light that curves around the scene, forming a halo-shaped canal where floating lanterns drift *upward* like fish; confetti, rice paper, petals, and tiny bells hang suspended in the flood as if time has been pinned. The Lantern Festival is everywhere but displaced: lanterns are not only in the air—some are stitched into clothing like organs, some are embedded in the stone floor like glowing fossils, some replace eyes in discarded masks piled in the foreground; one enormous lantern is split open like a fruit, spilling miniature lanterns that become fireflies that become distant stars. The Lyre of Orpheus is physically present and central: the beast cradles an ancient lyre whose strings extend beyond the instrument, threading through the twins’ hair and mouths and wrists, then continuing into the environment as taut luminous lines that *sew* separate objects into one—cups into skulls, flowers into wounds, doorways into mirrors, lovers’ silhouettes into a single outline—yet every fusion is ambiguous (comforting or violating, healing or trapping). Foreground: close, distorted corners packed with offerings and contradictions—broken wedding rings tangled with rosary beads, a bowl of salt that is also snow, a wet velvet cloak that drips not water but tiny glowing lanterns, a pair of shoes filled with blooming lotus and ash; a child’s toy is present only as a worn symbol (no child visible), half-melted into an adult glove. Midground: festival-goers are implied without clear faces—only hands, sleeves, and backs seen through hanging paper screens; their gestures read as applause, prayer, or surrender depending on interpretation. Background: curved walls bend inward like a cathedral made from ship ribs; doorways open onto different times of day at once—dawn, midnight, and a dim interior—each doorway leaking the same golden, tender light, as if the whole world is saying “thank you” and doesn’t know whether it’s blessing or debt. Everything is frozen at the peak of an impossible event, densely detailed with no empty space, every corner containing a second story, the central union simultaneously intimate and unsettling, inviting projection rather than explanation.
