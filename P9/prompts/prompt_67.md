A gilded banquet nave that feels half-cathedral, half-wedding-hall, crammed edge-to-edge with an altar-long table, bent golden arches, heavy drapery, candle clusters, mirrored panels, and a storm of floating silverware (forks, knives, spoons, chalices, serving domes) suspended at different depths like a frozen flock—each piece catching tiny reflections that create miniature scenes inside them. Center frame: mythic twins pressed close in quiet intimacy before a tall, cracked mirror that is not a surface but a threshold; their faces nearly touch, one’s hand at the other’s throat in a gesture that could be tenderness or restraint, their bodies partially clothed in ceremonial fragments (loose sash, undone gloves, jewelry biting gently into skin), with a palpable sense of shared breath. The “mirror” twin is not a simple reflection: it leans out of the glass, and where their torsos meet, the boundary becomes **solid liquidity**—marble that pours like water, gold that ripples like fabric, and wine that stands in midair as sculpted transparent waves; the floor itself behaves like a viscous, polished stone sea, frozen mid-surge around their feet, swallowing and birthing objects at once. Above and behind them, a **Rainbow Bridge/Bifrost** arcs through the nave as a physical prismatic causeway—part light, part stone, part mist—threading between balconies and chandeliers, casting colored bands that slice through faces, fruit, and metal, and landing like a private aurora on the twins’ shoulders. Woven into the architecture and the table setting is the **Derafsh Kaviani**: a jeweled, lion-and-sun-like war-standard turned into a ceremonial banner/veil—tattered edges, gold tassels, gem-studded patches—draped from a rib of the nave and also caught around the twins like a shared mantle, implying both sovereignty and surrender. A single **glass slipper** is physically present and unmistakable: hovering near their joined hips as if caught in the solidified current, its hollow interior filled with a trapped swirl of liquid-gold and a tiny, distorted reflection of the twins kissing / fighting / praying (ambiguous), while its mate is nowhere obvious—hint it might be hidden in the corner reflections or half-submerged in the stone-wine tide at the foreground. Pack the frame with intimate, unsettling details: foreground scattered with pearls, bitten pomegranate, wet lace, fractured masks, soft gloves, and a silver knife that casts a rainbow shadow; midground lined with faceless banquet “guests” that read as statues or living people—some dissolving into the floor’s flowing stone, some emerging from it, some holding empty plates like reliquaries; background crowded with gilded ribs, curtain folds, mirrored alcoves, and hovering cutlery forming a loose halo-cage around the twins. Lighting is close and warm (candle/amber) with prismatic spill from the Bifrost, emphasizing skin texture, breath, and the impossible viscosity of solid-liquid materials; no empty horizons, no calm negative space—every corner contains a clue, a reflection, or a contradiction, as if the entire hall is consummating a union it cannot explain. Aspect ratio 2:3.
