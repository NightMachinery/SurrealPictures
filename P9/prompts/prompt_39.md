Centered one-point perspective down a narrow forest aisle where bell-bearing branches arch overhead like a vaulted corridor, every twig hung with tiny tarnished bells, rosaries of seedpods, broken needles, and trembling dew; dense fog fills the space but is pierced by triumphant, ascending light—warm gold and bruised rose—so the mist itself looks celebratory, like lifted veils. At the vanishing point stands a mythic healer-weaver, barefoot on an exposed lattice of roots shaped like an operating table and a loom at once; their posture is calm yet victorious, chin raised, shoulders open, one hand offering a wound that is also a mouth, the other drawing luminous thread from it. Their body is partly nude, partly wrapped in translucent bandages and ceremonial cloth that clings like wet paper; the cloth is stitched with tiny closed eyes and pulse-like seams, suggesting care and desire in the same gesture. The impossible defining event is fragmentation: the protagonist, the trees, and even the fog are split into floating planar slices and suspended shards—like a shattered mirror holding a world mid-exhale—each fragment slightly misaligned, revealing contradictory layers (skin becomes bark, bark becomes fabric, fabric becomes muscle) while still maintaining the strict corridor perspective. The glowing thread bridges the gaps, suturing fragments together; in some places it ties knots, in others it laces like a corset, in others it becomes veins of light running through wood, implying passion as both binding and burning without any explicit act. A large stopped clock is physically embedded in a nearby trunk in the foreground, cracked open like a ribcage; its hands are frozen at an unreadable hour, gears spilling out as moths and petals, all suspended mid-fall. A flying kite is caught in the midground canopy, perfectly motionless in the fog: its paper skin torn into heartlike flaps, its tail a chain of bells and braided hair; the kite string is the same radiant thread drawn from the healer’s offered wound, disappearing into the fractured distance and reappearing from impossible angles. The Faravahar is present as a tangible object: a weathered, winged relief carved into a central tree-arch above the figure like a crest, with portions of the wings fragmented into hovering slats that echo the shattered scene; some bells hang from its feathers, ringing silently in the frozen air. Crowd every corner: foreground littered with stitched leaves, scalpels made of bone, tiny looms, spilled ink that becomes black water, and suspended droplets reflecting alternate versions of the figure’s face; midground crowded with intertwined arms of branches that resemble embracing limbs, bandage strips snagged on thorns like abandoned vows, and bells with tongues replaced by pearls; background packed with receding arches of branches and fog-choked silhouettes of additional fragmented figures that might be statues, memories, or future selves. No empty horizon—only depth lines converging, fragments hovering, and celebratory light rising through the fog as if the entire forest is witnessing a private triumph that could be healing, conquest, surrender, or regret.
