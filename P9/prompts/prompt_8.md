Vertical 2:3 frame, packed edge-to-edge: in a fog-choked forest where every branch bears tarnished little bells (some cracked open, some blooming moss, some containing tiny sleeping eyes), an androgynous vizier kneels half-submerged in drifting mist as if it were water, spine straight in ritual poise; their ceremonial headdress is shaped like an overturned chalice and their torso becomes a translucent vessel—inside, a soft milky radiance swirls with floating infant teeth, white feathers, and clear droplets that never fall, suggesting innocence held under impossible pressure. From their parted lips and fingertips, music becomes matter: solid staff-lines extrude into the air like ivory rails, notes crystallize into beads and moths, chords braid into ribbonlike tendons that wrap nearby trunks, and a silent “crescendo” is visible as concentric glass waves pushing the fog outward; several bells are mid-ring but frozen, their sound spilling out as physical petals, confetti, and small luminous fish. A lotus is present as both object and architecture: a real lotus cupped in the vizier’s hands with dew like pearls, while enormous lotus-petal forms also unfurl from the ground and tree-bark, doubling as seats, wounds, and altars; within one petal’s cup sits a shallow pool reflecting a different sky. The chimera is woven ambiguously through the scene—part living guardian, part carved reliquary: a lion’s ribcage made of bell-metal, a goat’s head emerging from a hollow trunk, a serpent tail dissolving into sheet-music, its eyes turned inward as if ashamed or blissful—its body tethered by the materialized melody. Foreground clutter: scattered masks with childlike faces, a broken compass filled with milk, wet lace, ceremonial keys, pomegranate seeds, rosary-like strings of notes, a small handprint in ash, and a toppled censer leaking incense that forms miniature choruses of faceless mouths. Midground and background are crowded with overlapping silhouettes—branches like antlers, hanging bells like fruit, drifting lotus pollen like snow, suspended droplets reflecting tiny alternate scenes (a wedding veil, a hospital curtain, a confession booth, an empty cradle), all lit by ecstatic, prismatic, pearlescent light that feels like transcendence and exposure at once; no empty horizon, no readable story, only a frozen climax of sound turned into touch.
