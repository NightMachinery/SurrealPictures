Isometric cutaway of a sprawling aerial circus district hanging over a storm-black void, every structure lashed together by cable bridges, rigging, and swollen gas balloons; the viewpoint reveals rooftops, streets, and multiple interior rooms at once like a sliced-open diorama—ticket booths, dressing chambers, animal cages, confessionals, cramped bunks—stacked in decorative planes with hard borders, inset panels, and mosaic-like inlays so space feels intentionally layered rather than deep. At the center, a mythic Beast (timeless, heavy, unmistakably sentient): horned and furred with the elegance of an old god, part-ringmaster and part-penitent—bare torso marked by faint scars and gold leaf cracks, a half-worn velvet coat slipping off one shoulder, posture suspended between kneeling and rising as if gravity forgot its verdict; its hands hover inches apart around a caduceus that is physically present as a staff and also echoed in the architecture—two serpentine aerial cables spiraling up around a central mast, their “wings” formed by torn pennants and bone-white trapeze frames. The entire district is caught in a frozen, impossible event of levitation and material transmutation: performers, masks, coins, teeth, feathers, and shattered glass float mid-fall; silk becomes skin where it touches skin, skin becomes satin where it’s ashamed to be seen; brass turns to salt, salt to glittering sugar, sugar to ash, ash to rose petals; balloon cords become veins, veins become braided rope, rope becomes living serpents that coil back into ornament. Sensuality is everywhere but never explicit: anonymous bodies (some nude, some half-costumed) drift in slow embrace and near-touch across rooms and bridges, hands reaching for mouths, ankles wrapped in ribbons that might be restraints or garlands, a kiss almost happening in one corner while a solitary figure watches from behind a mirror in another; desire reads as warmth struggling to survive. Creeping dread saturates the light: sickly carnival neon filtered through fog, bruised moonlight, long angled shadows that resemble bars, a hush like the moment before a scream. The Derafsh Kaviani is present as a battered jeweled standard—its star-and-ribbon glory stitched from old flags, jewelry, and shed skin—nailed into a central mast yet also held aloft by the Beast as if it cannot decide whether it’s a trophy, a wound, or a vow. A tidal wave is physically present and impossible: a colossal curling wall of seawater suspended in mid-break through the upper-right of the cutaway, threaded through the balloon forest and cable bridges, its interior crowded with floating carnival debris, lanterns, drowned flowers, pale hands, and glinting eyes; the water’s edge crystallizes into glassy lace where it touches the district, and in one room the wave pours upward into a ceiling like smoke. Fill every corner with clues that contradict: a pharmacy cabinet of love letters labeled like medicines; a lion’s mouth made of curtains; a bed that is also a lifeboat; a staircase turning into a tongue; confession tickets stamped “ADMIT ONE” pressed into a throat; tiny figures praying to a spotlight; a ring of candles that are actually teeth. No empty sky, no calm horizon—only dense, crowded, symbolic pressure, a paused climax of passion and fear where the viewer can’t tell if the Beast is protecting the city, birthing it, consuming it, or being crowned by it.
