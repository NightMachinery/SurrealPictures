Vertical 2:3 composition seen through a long telephoto lens that compresses distance into crowded, stacked planes: a salt desert so dense with detail it has no empty horizon, its crust cracked into lace-like polygons and glittering crystals, crossed by skeletal rail lines that resemble exposed ribs and vertebrae, converging toward a centered figure. In the exact middle stands a mythic, timeless “beloved-hermit”: androgynous, ageless, barefoot on the rail ties, a weatherworn cloak slipping from one shoulder to reveal vulnerable skin marked by salt, old bruises, and faint gold thread sutures; their posture is both tender and burdened—chin lifted as if offering love, spine bowed as if carrying an unbearable weight. Gravity is the visible force of the scene: the rails sag toward their body like metal kneeling; salt dunes cling to their calves as if magnetized; their shadow is not flat but a dense, dark substance pooling and dragging nearby objects; scattered relics (keys, a child’s toy, a wedding ring, a bone comb, a cracked mirror) hang mid-fall in the air around them, frozen at different heights as though gravity changes in layers. The defining impossibility is an explicit flora/fauna fusion erupting everywhere: a herd of pale animals made of living botanical anatomy—deer with ribcages that are open flower trellises, fish with translucent leaf-fins “swimming” through drifting salt, rabbits whose ears unfurl into ferns—threading through the rails; the rail spikes themselves sprout feathered moss and tiny teeth; blossoms open along tendons; bark becomes skin; petals become scales. Perched on the figure’s sternum like a brooch (and echoed again as a colossal presence in the far background) is a death’s-head moth whose wings are partly made of pressed flowers and partly of actual membrane, the skull marking readable only at certain angles; loose moth-scales drift like glittering ash across the frame. In one hand the figure cradles a miniature Tower of Babel constructed from stacked train sleepers, salt blocks, vertebrae, and broken language—tiny doors, staircases, and alphabets carved into it—yet in the background a full-sized Babel rises too, impossibly close due to compression, mid-tilt as if about to topple, its spiraling tiers crowded with small silhouetted scenes that contradict each other (a wedding procession moving backward, a funeral carried upward, children playing a quiet game with masks, two mirrored lovers reaching but not touching), all frozen in the same paused instant. The corners are busy: foreground salt crystals contain trapped eyelashes and tiny rail maps; a cracked canteen leaks upward into a floating ribbon of water; a nest made of wire and hair holds seeds shaped like teeth; far rails disappear into a mouth-like tunnel of bleached bones that blooms with lilies. Lighting and color convey childlike wonder without softness: prismatic, curiosity-filled dawn light that makes salt sparkle like a toy universe, luminous highlights on skin and rail metal, gentle iridescent haze packed with drifting motes—everything hyper-present, intimate, and unresolved, like a dream remembered with absolute certainty and no explanation.
