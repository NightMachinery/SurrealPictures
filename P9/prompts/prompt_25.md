Vertical 2:3 composition inside an opulent, claustrophobic bathhouse where rose steam hangs in thick layers and every surface is covered in cracked porcelain murals (mythic scenes, half-erased lovers, childhood friends, saints, monsters, and blank-faced bathers), the entire frame crowded with tiled ledges, hanging linens, brass pipes, floating petals, drifting ash, hairpins, keys, rings, and tiny handwritten notes that dissolve into vapor before they can be read. Center-midground: a timeless hermit-matchmaker sits on a narrow mosaic bench like a judge in exile—bare feet in shallow water, a heavy half-robe slipping off one shoulder, skin marked with faint map-like scars, face obscured by wet veil-cloth and steam so their age and gender remain uncertain; their posture is both protective and weary, as if they have been waiting centuries. From their shoulders emerge two living serpents (Zahhak’s shoulder serpents) that coil like intimate shawls around their throat and arms, not attacking—whispering into their ear, tasting the air, tugging gently at threads the way a friend tugs you back from the edge. In their lap: a small lacquered box of matchsticks and a spool of red thread; they are caught in the frozen instant of tying a knot between two distant wrists that never quite meet—hands reaching from opposite sides of the scene (one from behind a curtain of steam, one from within a mural crack), fingertips separated by a hair-thin pane of invisible glass, the thread passing through tile, mirror, and flesh as if boundaries don’t exist, yet the bodies remain painfully apart. The defining broken-physics “containment” impossibility dominates the room: porcelain basins and perfume bottles contain entire impossible worlds—an ocean trapped in a teacup without spilling, a miniature bathhouse folded inside a hand mirror that reflects a different season, rose steam sealed inside delicate floating porcelain spheres that drift like lanterns while still leaking tendrils of scent, and a towel that unfolds into a corridor where silhouettes of friends walk away forever; suspended droplets of water hold tiny scenes inside them (two friends laughing, two friends grieving, two friends betraying each other) like trapped memories. To the left foreground: a burning bush grows from a brass brazier beside the hermit, its leaves made of glazed porcelain and its flames behaving like slow underwater petals—fire that illuminates but does not consume, casting warm blush light that fights a cooler, sickly-green glow coming from deeper pools. To the right midground and background: a basilisk is physically present yet ambiguous—part living creature, part mosaic relief—coiled along a porcelain mural seam; its eye is a wet gemstone that turns whatever it “looks at” into glassy stillness (a splash frozen midair, a handprint petrified on steam), but its gaze also resembles longing rather than violence, as if it preserves what it cannot hold. Everywhere, friendship/bond is shown as architecture reacting: pairs of pipes braided together like intertwined arms, twin faucets sharing one stream, two lockers with one keyhole, two shadows cast by one body, and red thread stitching cracks in the murals while also strangling them; the air itself seems to ache with distance—warm rose light in the foreground fading into bruised blue in the back, figures half-seen through steam reaching for one another across thresholds that should not exist. Corners packed with small, interpretable contradictions: a child’s bath toy floating beside a funeral wreath; a bridal comb tangled with a snake scale; a mouthless mask resting on a lover’s towel; a doorway too small for any body yet clearly used; a locked jar full of laughter (silent bubbles); a cracked mirror reflecting an embrace that the room refuses to allow. Freeze the entire scene at the exact moment before something irreversible happens—every gesture suspended, every container impossibly full, every bond both tender and suffocating—so the image feels like a remembered dream that insists it is personal while never revealing whose.
