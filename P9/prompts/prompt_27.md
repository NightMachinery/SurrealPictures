Vertical 2:3 illustration framed like a paper-theater proscenium: visible layered cut-paper planes, stacked borders, stitched seams, and tiny inset “stage wings” that crowd the edges with miniature tableaux (a broken cradle made of husks, a wedding veil pinned to a scarecrow, a funeral wreath braided from wheat and hair, masks half-buried in seed). Center stage stands a mythic elder fused with a phoenix: an ageless figure with weathered skin and ember-veined wings that emerge from the shoulder blades like singed parchment; one bare foot rooted in black soil, the other hovering as if mid-step, frozen. Their posture is both priestly and exhausted—spine bent under invisible years, chin lifted in stubborn tenderness—draped in a heavy harvest-cloth that looks like it was woven from straw, gold leaf, and ash; hints of artistic nudity feel vulnerable rather than erotic. Behind them rises the Derafsh Kaviani as a towering standard that doubles as an architectural spine: a dark, ancient leather banner-panel sewn with gemstone constellations, sun-rosette medallions, and dangling tassels that clink like teeth; it is nailed into the earth like a totem and also unfurls like a wing. Ariadne’s thread is physically present as a single continuous filament—blood-red and luminous—looping from the elder’s fingers, stitching through the layered paper planes, lacing around lightning-struck prairie totems, and vanishing into inset borders like a path through a labyrinth; it tangles around throats, wrists, corn stalks, and broken instruments without ever clearly binding or rescuing anyone. The setting is a storm prairie packed with charred totems and scarecrow-figures: poles carved with faces, antlers, hands, and harvest symbols, all split by lightning; no empty horizon—everything is dense, crowded, and pressing inward, as if the land itself is a cramped stage set that is birthing the protagonist. The impossible “Frozen Dream” event is blatant: material transmutation and synesthesia mid-strike—lightning hits a totem and the bolt turns into a torrent of ripe fruit, coins, teeth, and glass seed; rain falls upward as warm honey; wheat heads combust into flocks of paper birds; smoke condenses into salt crystals; spilled grain becomes tiny beating hearts; the air is filled with suspended debris (petals, ash, jewelry, feathers, torn letters with no readable words). Sound and scent are visible: thunder appears as thick braided ribbons that wrap around objects like pressure, and perfume rises as colored geometry that stains the sky; the elder “harvests” these sensations with open hands as if gathering crops from the storm. Wonder dominates the lighting: childlike discovery in the glow—prismatic, lantern-warm highlights inside the storm-dark, with luminous edges on every layer as though the whole scene is backlit paper. Populate foreground/midground/background with ambiguous human traces: half-emerged figures made of straw and skin, hands offering and refusing, a faceless lover’s silhouette in a torn curtain, a kneeling double of the elder made of ash, a small phoenix chick made of ember-glass perched on a skull-shaped gourd—everything paused at the brink of transformation, asking whether this is abundance as blessing, burden, or ransom. No empty space, no clear single narrative, no readable text.
