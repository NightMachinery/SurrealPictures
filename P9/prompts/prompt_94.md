Vertical 2:3 frame, a fog-choked forest so dense there is no horizon: every branch bears tiny tarnished bells and seedpods that look like closed eyes; the air is crowded with drifting pollen, loose feathers, courtroom seals, moths, and splinters of mirror. At the center, an androgynous adult trickster with a childlike grin and exhausted eyes levitates inches above a nest of roots, knees tucked as if mid-prank yet holding the stillness of a relic; their body is partly wrapped in mismatched costume fragments (harlequin sleeve, school-uniform collar, judge’s sash) and partly bare in a classical, vulnerable way, skin mapped with faint inked constellations like old verdicts. Their face is a mask that can’t decide what it is: porcelain cracked to reveal living skin beneath, while a second “face” (a soft theatrical mask) hangs from their fingers, and a third face appears as a reflection in a floating shard of mirror—none agreeing on the same expression. The impossible physics is overt: not only the figure, but whole layers of the forest levitate—rings of leaves, clods of earth with roots dangling like hair, bells suspended mid-swing, droplets of fog frozen as pearls, and a spiral of scattered masks orbiting the protagonist like a private solar system. Woven into the scene as totems: a large stopped clock embedded in a split tree trunk at chest height, its hands snapped at an ambiguous hour, with beetles crawling beneath the glass as if time is a terrarium; a pair of scales of justice grown from pale wood and bone, floating level beside the figure, each pan holding contradictory offerings (one a beating pomegranate heart, the other a stack of blank legal papers that bleed color into the mist); and the Derafsh Kaviani as a tattered, jewel-studded banner-standard lashed to a hovering branch behind them, its fabric alive with tiny stitched flames and crowned motifs, half-swallowed by fog, half-igniting it into stained-glass color. The forest itself performs illusion: bark peels into masquerade faces; bell shadows form silhouettes of embraces and separations; branches resemble hands offering and refusing; roots curl into ambiguous cradles and restraints. Lighting and color convey explosive vitality trapped in suspension—hot, luminous reds and golds pulsing through the fog like breath, cool teal mist in the depths, and sharp iridescent highlights on bells and mirror fragments—everything poised at the instant before either celebration or sentence, tenderness or trick, confession or escape. No empty space: every corner contains a small, interpretable omen (a tiny puppet without strings, a bitten apple floating upward, a blindfold caught on a thorn, a child’s toy crown turned to ash, a kiss-mark on a mask, a seed sprouting inside a gavel-shaped knot of wood). No text, no clear single storyline—only a crowded, frozen dream that insists it is about masks, judgment, and the intoxicating freedom of not obeying gravity.
