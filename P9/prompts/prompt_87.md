Vertical 2:3 composition inside a funhouse cathedral where the nave is a labyrinth of warped mirrors, ribbed arches that bend like soft metal, and towering gilded cages hung like chandeliers; every surface reflects a different version of the same moment. In the center, a mythic oracle advances one bare foot onto an impossible stair that tilts toward the viewer: their body is partly human, partly a living swarm—moths, bees, paper prayers, and black ink droplets cohering into ribs, hair, and a shifting cloak—yet their posture is calm, forward, and fearless, chin lifted as if stepping into judgment. Gravity is visible: the air itself sags in heavy curtains; rosary beads, coins, shed feathers, and broken mirror shards orbit the oracle in dense rings like a private planet, while other objects are crushed to the floor in deep dents—candles bent, marble cracked, cage bars bowed—suggesting the space cannot decide what is light and what is unbearable. The broken logic is “mechanical nature”: vines are braided clockwork with leaf-teeth that interlock; mechanical doves molt brass feathers; roses open on hinge-pins; a waterfall of sand pours upward into a gear-driven cloud; moth wings reveal tiny schematics; cathedral organs breathe with pistons like lungs. The spinning wheel is monumental and physical—an altar-sized wheel/loom fused to the architecture—its spokes turning without motion blur, frozen mid-spin, drawing threads that become literal gravity-lines tugging at bodies and objects. The Faravahar appears as a radiant, three-dimensional emblem suspended where a stained-glass rose window should be, its wings made of layered mirror panels and gilded feathers; it casts contradictory shadows that point in multiple directions at once. A stopped clock is present as an undeniable totem: its cracked face embedded in the oracle’s sternum like a relic, and a second, smaller clock clenched in their hand, both halted at different times; loose clock hands drift through the air like needles. Crowd the frame with ambiguous human vulnerability: in the foreground, a toppled candelabrum, scattered keys, silk gloves, a cracked mask, and a naked marble figure that may be a living person (breathing, ashamed, unafraid) half-hidden behind cage filigree; in the mirrors, fragments of faces and clasped hands that don’t match any body in the room; in the cages, suspended bodies posed like saints or prisoners, tasteful nudity implied by drapery and bars, never explicit—each reflection rewriting whether they are being protected, displayed, punished, or saved. Freeze the dream at the instant a mirror wall is shattering outward, each shard reflecting a different moral: tenderness, dread, ecstasy, grief, triumph. Lighting communicates courage: a warm, advancing gold from low-left like a sunrise inside stone, cutting through cooler blue-green shadows; highlights bite on gilding and glass, making the oracle feel heavier than architecture, yet moving anyway. Fill every corner with floating debris (petals, screws, prayer slips, feathers, sand, tiny gears) so the viewer can’t find empty air, only questions.
