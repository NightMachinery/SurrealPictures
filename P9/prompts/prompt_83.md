Portrait 2:3, a moonlit meadow so dense with waist‑high silver grass and wildflowers it feels like an interior, ringed tightly by leaning standing stones carved with worn, half-erased faces; at the center stands a mythic guardian figure (androgynous adult body, classical proportions, vulnerable yet unbreakable stance: feet planted, chest lifted as if accepting an invisible crown), but their mantle is a living swarm—hundreds of moths, bees, tiny birds, paper masks, and laughing teeth-like petals orbiting them in a tight halo, merging into a cloak that is both protection and infestation; from the guardian’s shoulders emerge Zahhak’s two serpents—thick, ancient, affectionate and predatory at once—coiling forward to whisper into the guardian’s ears and to taste the air, their scales catching moon-gold highlights; the guardian holds a half-burned candle like a relic, its flame frozen mid-flicker, wax spilling in impossible slow motion into sculpted miniature bodies and faces (some smiling, some sobbing), the melted wax forming a ladder that never reaches the ground. The defining impossibility is violent displacement: gravity has been moved elsewhere—shadows detach and drift upward like black kites, laughter itself becomes a physical force that shoves objects out of their rightful places; several standing stones float a few inches above the grass while their bases sit elsewhere, displaced like mismatched puzzle pieces; the moon appears twice—one huge and low as if resting among the flowers like a fallen lamp, another faint and far above—while fragments of a ballroom ceiling (chandelier crystals, velvet curtains, a cracked mirror, a gilt frame) hang in midair over the meadow as if an indoor room has been torn out and relocated into the night. Triumph saturates the light: a radiant, victorious glow blooms from behind the guardian’s ribs and through the swarm, casting prismatic rim light on everything, like the afterimage of a roar of applause; yet the laughter is ambiguous—visible as pearly bubbles, torn carnival ribbons, and silent open mouths in the stones, suggesting ecstasy, shame, and relief at once. Crowd every corner: foreground hands made of grass reaching up to catch falling confetti-moths; tiny nude figurines of wax climbing the candle-drip, some embracing, some pushing away; midground masks half-buried in petals, a toppled goblet spilling moonlight, a severed braid of hair woven into flowers, a snake shedding a skin that becomes lace; background stones packed close like an audience, each slit with a different expression, while displaced furniture legs and doorway thresholds hover without rooms attached. Freeze everything mid-event—no motion blur—so the scene feels like a paused, impossible ovation where the body is both altar and battleground; no readable story, only layered symbols, sensual tension, and a crowded dream-logic puzzle; no text.
