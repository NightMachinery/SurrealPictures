Portrait 2:3, extreme low-angle as if the viewer is kneeling on ink-black marble: a monumental chapel of mirrored confessionals rises overhead like a cathedral made of obsidian and wet glass, every surface reflecting and multiplying itself. Centered above the viewer, an androgynous figure stands on a narrow dais—part intimate companion, part sovereign—wearing a mismatched regalia of a slightly too-large coronet and a friend’s soft, familiar garment slipping from one shoulder; their posture is both welcoming and unanswerable (one hand extended downward in reassurance, the other gripping a relic like a verdict). In that raised hand: a human skull used as a chalice, its interior filled with luminous milk-white water; from the skull grows a miniature living Cypress of Kashmar, impossibly ancient in miniature, roots threading through teeth and eye sockets, needles catching pale light like handwriting. Innocence/purity appears everywhere but never comfortably: a spotless white veil draped over barbed confessional lattice; a childlike paper crown floating in a basin of clear water; lilies pressed into black stone; tiny fingerprints in ash; a pristine ribbon tied around a key that cannot fit any lock. The defining impossible feature is blatant infinite recursion: each confessional door contains a mirror that shows the same door opening into another confessional, shrinking into endless depth; the figure’s eyes reflect the chapel, and inside those reflections the figure repeats again holding the same skull-and-cypress; the floor is a mirror of the ceiling, yet the “reflection” has different architecture—an inverted chapel beneath the chapel—creating a split-level world where upper and lower realities disagree while perfectly aligning at the horizon line of the dais. Enforce a designed, crowded collage framing: the scene is divided into kaleidoscopic quadrants by cross-shaped architectural ribs and gilded inlay, with near-identical repetitions of the central figure and confessionals in each quadrant—except for intentional breaks where the pattern slips (a missing reflection, a reversed skull, a cypress that becomes a thorned spine, a confessional that opens onto open sky-blackness). The atmosphere is creeping dread: dim greenish candlelight, cold pearl highlights, heavy shadows that feel moist, drifting motes of torn confession slips, moth wings, rosary beads, fallen teeth, and black feathers suspended midair like time has stopped mid-exhale. Crowd the corners with partial bodies and suggestions: bare feet behind slats, a hand pressing from inside a mirror as if glass were skin, veiled faces doubled and tripled in reflections, a regal train that turns into a shroud that turns into a curtain. Everything must feel frozen in the instant before a revelation or a betrayal, intimate yet monumental, tender yet accusatory—an elaborate visual riddle with no single readable story.
