Vertical 2:3 frame, viewer positioned low at knee-height as if kneeling at the threshold of an impossible sanctuary/clinic/ballroom; ultra-wide lens distortion bends the walls and floor into gentle curves, corners swelling with detail. In the center stands a mythic celebrant—an androgynous adult figure, serene and unblinking—half draped in ceremonial bandages that read as both medical gauze and bridal fabric; portions of their skin are bare with classical vulnerability, scars rendered as faint constellations. Their “swarm” is not outside them but part of them: hundreds of tiny moths/bees/miniature masked people made of paper-thin anatomy drift in a slow orbit from their ribs and hair, like a living aura, each carrying minute offerings (buttons, pills, teeth, pearls, keys, petals), all suspended mid-motion as if time has stopped.

The defining broken-physics event: a river of clear water flows upward from a cracked tile at the celebrant’s feet into their open palms, then freezes into floating droplets that become translucent stitches sealing invisible wounds in the air; gravity is inconsistent—petals fall upward, dust hangs in layered sheets, and a chandelier’s light pools like liquid on the ceiling. Behind the celebrant, a full-sized Trojan horse dominates the midground, not as a prop but as architecture: its wooden body is split open like a reliquary, revealing a quiet interior room with a neatly made bed, a bath, and a small altar; from its hollow belly spill not soldiers but folded linens, confession letters, and tiny doors leading nowhere. The celebrant holds a wilting bouquet pressed to their sternum—flowers browned at the edges, stems bound with a tourniquet ribbon—yet each dying blossom sheds bright seeds that sprout into delicate new veins across nearby surfaces.

An eclipse hangs impossibly close: a dark disk centered in an oculus above, its corona casting a calm, milky rim light that turns everything soft and lucid; the eclipse’s shadow also appears as a second halo behind the celebrant’s head, slightly misaligned, as if two realities overlap. The atmosphere is deep serenity—cool dawn tones with warm undertones, breath-like haze, no violence, only quiet intensity. Fill foreground with intimate debris: a cracked mirror reflecting a different angle of the celebrant’s face; discarded masks (theatrical, medical, animal) arranged like sleeping birds; an overturned champagne flute that pours upward into a hovering spiral; a bowl of salt with fingerprints; a rosary tangled with IV tubing; a pair of shoes filled with seawater; scattered photo negatives that show blank silhouettes. Midground corners teem: a seated figure made of stitched bandages dissolving into butterflies; a dog or deer sleeping with eyes open; hands emerging from curtains offering nothing; a clock with missing hands; a doorframe opening onto sky. Background curves into paradoxical depth: staircases that lead into the Trojan horse and also out of it; columns that are bones; murals that look like skin; windows showing the eclipse and simultaneously a bright noon. Everything crowded, layered, tactile, frozen at the most emotionally ambiguous instant—tenderness and dread, shame and relief, celebration and convalescence—no text, no symbols explained, no single narrative.
