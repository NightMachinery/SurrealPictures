Vertical 2:3 frame built as an ascending spiral that climbs from a roiling “cloud ocean” at the bottom edge up to a cliffside elevator station carved into black rock and brass—every layer crowded with ritual debris and frozen motion: prayer cords knotted to pulley wheels, incense smoke crystallized into beads, paper seals fluttering mid-tear, scattered rice and salt forming looping mandalas that repeat like clockwork, a ring of worn sandals, masks, and broken hourglasses orbiting a central spiral stair that coils through the station like a vertebra. At the spiral’s focal bend stands a mythic ninja—not generic, but heavy with age and vow—wrapped in layered, weathered cloth and lacquered armor plates stitched with tiny talismans; their face half-veiled, eyes calm and unreadable, one hand poised as if finishing a mudra, the other gripping the pole of a wedding canopy that is both shelter and burden. The canopy’s fabric is physically present and intricate (beaded fringe, embroidered constellations, hidden stains, torn repairs), yet it behaves impossibly: it unfurls upward and becomes the “sky” itself—an enormous, cathedral-sized wedding canopy replacing the heavens, its underside lit from within by a living aurora borealis that pours through the seams in electric ribbons, casting verdant and magenta light like pulse and breath across every surface. Make the sky replacement unmistakable and dominant: above the station there is no atmosphere—only the vast inverted interior of an elevator shaft opening into infinity, with countless elevator doors suspended like petals around the spiral, each door ajar to a different loop of the same moment (wilted flowers becoming fresh, ash becoming seeds, a veil becoming a shroud), and auroral light threading through them like nerves. Encode “ritual / cycle” everywhere without a single readable story: offerings circling on conveyor belts that lead nowhere, a bridal procession reduced to symbols (gloved hands holding nothing, a veil caught on a hook, a bouquet turning to moths), repeating circular footprints in chalk that climb the spiral, and the ninja appearing as subtle temporal echoes along the ascent—three or four faintly offset “beats” of the same figure in slightly different posture, like a sequence trapped in one frame. Crowd foreground, midground, background with ambiguous bodies and tenderness without explicitness: classical nude figures as cracked statues and translucent silhouettes integrated into machinery (backs arched like bridges, hands turned into gears, ribs as ladder rungs), intimate gestures that could read as comfort or control; faces partially obscured by veils, rope, hair, or paper seals. Below, the cloud ocean is not empty: it is dense with floating elevator cages, drifting wedding chairs, lanterns, feathers, petals, cicada shells, and small personal objects (keys, letters, rings) suspended in still air as if gravity is paused. Lighting and color must radiate explosive vitality—aurora-driven glow, prismatic highlights, hard rim light on fabric and metal, warm pulses inside the canopy like a heartbeat—while the overall scene remains a paradoxical, frozen critical instant that feels both celebratory and ominous, overflowing with clues that refuse to resolve into one narrative.
