Bird’s-eye, top-down diorama view into a cramped, labyrinthine conservatory-ballroom hybrid (like a dollhouse cutaway with many rooms visible at once), every surface crowded with objects and small vignettes; at the central threshold stands a mythic Guardian–Romantist, androgynous and timeless, bare skin partly veiled by a heavy embroidered cloak slipping off one shoulder, posture both protective and yearning (one hand braced on a doorway, the other offering a masquerade mask as if it were a vow); the defining impossibility is blatant **duplication**: the protagonist appears **three times** in the same frame in identical pose but at different ages/scales (youth/adult/elder), their cloaks overlapping like copied transparencies, while the rooms themselves repeat as near-perfect clones (two identical staircases leading to the same landing, mirrored beds with the same rumpled sheets, duplicated bouquets that bloom in sync), and even shadows are doubled and misaligned; the theme of **bloom/growth** spreads through everything—flowers sprout from cracks in tiles, vines lace around wrists and banisters like jewelry, petals erupt from open letters and from the seams of garments, a ribcage-shaped trellis in one corner grows roses inward, fruiting branches push through picture frames, and tiny seedlings pierce masks and gloves; a **Cerberus** is physically present as a guardian-pet-totem woven into the architecture: three-headed dog lounging across a doorway like a living lock, each head alert in a different direction, with faintly duplicated paws (extra paw-prints in midair as if the creature has been copied mid-step); the air is thick with suspended debris frozen mid-event—spilled wine droplets hanging like garnets, floating hairpins, torn lace, drifting pollen, cracked mirror shards, coins, and tiny paper boats made from love notes; corners and margins contain “tiny narrative clusters” that contradict each other: miniature masked dancers paused mid-bow on a tabletop stage, a small figure watering a plant that is watering them back, a hand emerging from a drawer offering a ring to nobody, a pair of identical keys arguing in opposite directions, a bedtime scene duplicated in two rooms with different sleepers, a pocket watch blooming into a chrysalis; intimate whimsy in lighting—warm lamplight and candleglow tucked into alcoves, soft moonlight entering from two duplicated windows at incompatible angles, gentle pastel warmth edged with quiet dread in the deepest shadows; no empty space anywhere, maximum micro-detail in foreground/midground/background, every object hinting at touch, shame, tenderness, appetite, grief; the scene must feel like a single frozen heartbeat of an impossible event, polysemic and unreadable as a single story; aspect ratio 2:3; no text, no symbols or logos.
