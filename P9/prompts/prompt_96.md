Vertical 2:3 composition, a crowded “frozen dream” tableau built like a designed poster: stacked flat planes and hard-edged silhouette cutouts, a thick border of inset panels and mosaic fragments that echo the central scene (tiny vignettes of hands, mouths, rings, burned petals, broken instruments, closed eyes, stitched skin, spilled ink) while refusing to resolve into a single story. In the center, an ageless musician-mentor sits like a mythic colossus on a throne that is also an open, giant stringed instrument; their posture is calm and instructive yet unbearably intimate—one hand poised as if to conduct a heartbeat, the other cradling a small brazier shaped like a heart/eye containing the Eternal Flame of Atar, the fire perfectly suspended mid-flicker, casting ember-light that becomes visible notation, turning into birds, then into ash, then into stars. The mentor’s body is a deliberate contradiction: one side classical nude skin with bruised tenderness and visible breath fog, the other side transmuted material (polished brass, cracked marble, lacquered wood grain) seamlessly fused at the spine; their hair is a veil of sheet-music that frays into smoke, and their ribs read as harp ribs, implying music as anatomy. From their raised arms, a wedding canopy is held aloft—part fabric, part architectural beam, part stretched skin of a drum—its four corners anchored by impossibly giant nails that are also candles and tuning pegs; beneath it, two mid-sized figures (gender-ambiguous, adult, vulnerable) are caught in the exact instant of union: their faces nearly meet, but the “kiss” is interrupted by material transmutation—one figure’s lips become gold leaf, the other’s become salt; fingers melt into braided rope that becomes vascular tubing that becomes vine; fabric becomes water; jewelry becomes bone; a veil becomes a map; their shadows detach and embrace each other independently. The ground plane is a mosaic of wedding tiles and funeral stones; the tiles lift off like paper, rotating as cutouts, revealing a void filled with a miniature city and a sleeping body curled like a fetus, both scaled too small to be real. Gigantism dominates: the mentor’s instrument-throne spans the horizon; its strings arc upward into the sky as luminous bridges, and each plucked string solidifies into a different substance midair (glass, hair, smoke, coral, ink), freezing as suspended debris that crowds every corner. Background: a cosmic interior/exterior hybrid—cathedral pillars made of stacked books and vertebrae, planets hanging like lamps, a distant ocean standing upright like a curtain—lit with cold starlight and hot ember glow that clash into awe. Include many witnesses but only as ambiguous silhouettes cut from different materials (paper cutout mourners, marble children, transparent lovers, masked elders), all facing different directions as if remembering different versions of the same moment; no empty space anywhere, every margin packed with floating confetti that alternates between ash and flower petals, and tiny hidden symbols (rings that are eclipses, flames that are eyes, canopies that are cages) to keep the image polysemic, tender, and quietly terrifying.
