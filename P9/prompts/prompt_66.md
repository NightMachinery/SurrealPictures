Isometric cutaway of a cinder valley choked with **smoking glass dunes**, the entire 2:3 frame crowded like a dream-diagram: a half-buried palace-labyrinth made of **edible architecture** (honeycomb buttresses, marzipan arches, crusty bread staircases, translucent fruit-stained windows, sugar tiles cracked like teeth) is being slowly and tenderly consumed—bite-marks in walls, crumbs drifting in the air, syrup seeping into ash—yet the structure is simultaneously **repairing itself** with visible sutures of gold thread, resin bandages, and delicate lotus-fiber seams that pull shattered glass and charred stone back together. At the center, seated on a throne that is also a hospital bed and also an altar, a mythic **vizier-beast** presides: tall, heavy with age and authority, draped in layered ceremonial robes whose patterns resemble anatomical drawings and prayer rugs; the head is not fully human—antlered or leonine or mask-like—yet the eyes are unmistakably gentle and exhausted; one clawed hand steadies a bare human shoulder (ambiguous gender), the other holds an **unsealed love letter** the size of a veil, its ink smeared like tears and its words almost-legible but never readable, the paper folding into bandages that wrap wounds, bind broken porcelain bones, and tie closed cracks in the edible walls. Embedded in the vizier-beast’s chest or throne canopy is a large **stopped clock** with missing teeth and frozen hands; its face is partly eaten, yet its stillness radiates outward: suspended crumbs, halted drips of honey, ash motes paused mid-fall, a broken cup mid-shatter—everything caught in a single “almost” moment of recovery. From above, **celestial descent** is overt and impossible: the moon hangs low like a descending lantern, a staircase of stars pours down into the cutaway rooms, constellations unravel into ribbons that thread through corridors, and a comet’s tail becomes a soft sheet tucked around sleeping figures; these falling lights do not burn—they soothe, like cool compresses, illuminating tender touch, quiet shame, and careful care without explaining why. A **lotus** is physically present and multiplied: one blooms in a basin of ash-water at the vizier-beast’s feet; another sprouts from a cracked hourglass; tiny lotus buds emerge between glass-dune shards and from inside bite-marks in the candy walls, suggesting healing that is both earned and devoured. Populate every corner with ambiguous vignettes frozen mid-gesture: hands offering a spoonful of sugared medicine; a mouth near a wall as if kissing or feeding; a figure wearing a crown of bandages writing on skin; moths made of burnt paper orbiting the stopped clock; medical instruments that are also cutlery; mirrors that show mismatched bodies; warm cloth and cool glass pressed together; sealed envelopes used as shingles; tiny stairwells leading into a throat-shaped chamber; smoke that curls into soft embraces. The overall light feels like gentle love—dawn-warm and candle-close—casting tender highlights on skin, ash, and glass while preserving deep shadows for dread and longing; no empty horizons, only layered dunes, crowded rooms, drifting debris, and impossible descending sky pressed tightly into the scene, asking a question it refuses to answer.
