Vertical 2:3 frame, packed edge-to-edge: in a cramped redwood valley where trunks rise like cathedral columns, dozens of suspended village pods (woven cocoons, glass lanterns, rope bridges, dangling staircases, prayer flags, wind chimes, half-open doors with silhouettes) crowd the midair canopy; everything is caught in a paused catastrophe—ash, pollen, torn fabric, river-mist, and splinters of bark hang motionless, a lightning bolt frozen mid-strike. Center foreground stands a mythic, timeless figure—part phoenix, part living shadow—an androgynous body with vulnerable bare skin veiled by charred, translucent drapery; one side blooms with ember-feathers and faint heat-haze, the other side is soot-dark and matte, as if carved from night. Their shadow is displaced: it detaches from their feet and climbs the nearest trunk like a second body, wrapping around branches to form a darker pair of wings that do not match their posture. The figure’s head is bowed yet luminous, as if mid-epiphany; from their sternum a clean, impossible clarity radiates—thin, razor-straight beams and crystalline planes that slice through fog, revealing hidden layers of the world (constellations inside tree rings, small reflective “truth” shards embedded in moss, eyes opening in knots of wood) while also erasing details nearby into blank silhouette. Behind them, a lightning-struck redwood is split open like a wound; its interior glows with white-gold sap and blackened veins, the frozen lightning branching into the air as a geometric web that links to the hanging pods like strings of a puppet theatre. At the base of the split tree crouches a Cerberus that feels both protective and accusatory: three heads formed from different substances (root and antler, smoke and ember, wet river-stone), each staring in a different direction; its leashes are not held but instead vanish upward into displaced gravity. A death’s-head moth, unnervingly large, hovers close to the protagonist’s face and collarbone—its skull-mark pattern sharp, its powdery scales shedding in suspended dust that becomes tiny floating masks and cinders. The surreal displacement is overt: the river runs vertically up a trunk like a ribbon, stones drift like slow planets, a pod-village “street” hangs sideways in open air with furniture pinned to nothing, and pieces of the sky appear sunk into puddles while roots braid across the air as if water. Lighting is cosmic-awe and explosive-life at once: cold starlit shafts from above collide with warm volcanic glow from the struck tree and the phoenix side of the body, creating contradictory highlights; every corner contains a clue (rings, keys, feathers, bitten fruit, broken mirrors, half-written letters, tiny figures frozen mid-step), yet no single story resolves—only a dense, intimate paradox of revelation, shame, tenderness, and dread suspended in perfect stillness.
