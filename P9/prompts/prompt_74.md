Vertical 2:3 illustration, worm’s-eye view from ground level inside a perfume bazaar beneath vast mirrored domes; the camera looks up through a towering foreground ornament: an oversized filigreed incense burner and wrought-iron railing wrapped in living vines, half-obscured by hanging veils, bead curtains, and drifting lace that occlude the scene in layered partitions (foreground/midground/background packed—no open sky). Centered above the viewer on a precarious stall-throne of stacked perfume bottles and carved wood, a mythic phoenix–storyteller: an androgynous, timeless figure with soot-kissed skin and faint gold scars, partly unclothed but draped in a mantle of charred feathers that reads like both wings and a tattered book; posture suspended between collapse and ascension, one hand open in a gesture of blessing/thanks, the other gripping an ornate Pandora’s box. The box is cracked open just enough to spill impossible contents: not smoke, but small, exquisitely clear “answers” (tiny glass dioramas, alphabet fragments, memories-as-insects, keys, teeth, vows) that freeze mid-emergence. A cradle is physically present and central—woven from translucent bottle glass, ribbon, and feathers—cradling an ambiguous luminous object (egg/heart/small sun) that casts a precise beam upward; that beam refracts through the bazaar’s perfume haze into prismatic lines that “cut” the scene into sudden clarity, as if revelation is a tangible architecture. A halo exists but unstable: a hovering ring of mirrored shards around/behind the protagonist’s head, doubling as a fragment of the dome’s reflection; within it, contradictory reflections show different ages, genders, and outcomes for the same figure. Physics is loudly broken by soft sculpture and solid liquidity: perfume pours like heavy molten marble yet holds its shape in midair as rigid amber ribbons; stone statues of merchants and lovers sag like warm wax, their faces sliding into masks; droplets of liquid light are faceted like gemstones and clatter upward; a “solid” pool of scent behaves like glass you can stand on while rippling like water. The bazaar is crowded and intimate: faceless vendors, half-veiled patrons, mannequins, and saintlike beggars press in; many hands extend offerings (sealed vials, incense, coins, letters, bandages, flowers), suggesting overflowing gratitude without a single readable story—some hands tender, some transactional, some pleading, some reverent. In every corner: hanging labels with unreadable names, moths with map-pattern wings, floating petals mixed with ash, tiny bells caught in hair, spilled pearls, broken combs, censers exhaling ribbons that turn into stairs; the mirrored domes above multiply everything into infinite versions, including a barely-there second cradle and a second box that may be a reflection or a threat. Lighting and color mood: warm, honeyed, dawnlike illumination that feels like “thank you” made visible—golden highlights, soft halos of amber and rose—yet threaded with quiet dread in the deepest shadows under the rails and veils, as if the epiphany costs something.
