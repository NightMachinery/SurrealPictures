Vertical 2:3 composition, tightly framed with no empty horizon: inside a desert necropolis whose tomb chambers have been converted into crowded artisan studios (kilns glowing, looms threaded through sarcophagus niches, pigment bowls on gravestones, ladders leaning into carved mausoleum windows, hanging textiles and drying clay masks everywhere). In the center foreground stands a mythic musician-avatar on a floor of cracked funerary mosaic and scattered bone-white pottery shards, posture calm yet burdened—spine straight, one bare foot grounded, the other hovering a finger’s width above the tiles as if time paused mid-step; their body is partially draped in stitched veils and instrument straps, skin marked with faint gold-leaf repairs like healed scars. Their defining impossibility: they have no face—only a smooth, luminous absence where features should be, as if the air has been erased; around the empty “face” floats a slow halo of masks (comedy/tragedy, animal, lover, executioner, child) held in mid-orbit, each mask casting a shadow that doesn’t match its shape. From the musician’s shoulders emerge two living serpents (Zahhak’s totems), not attacking but tenderly entwined—one serpent’s mouth gently pinches a loose thread as if mending, the other coils around the musician’s throat like a protective scarf; their scales catch the warm kiln-light, eyes reflecting compassion rather than threat. The instrument is itself a paradox: a bowed lute/viola whose body is also a cornucopia, its bell-mouth pressed to the musician’s ribs; from the horn spills an impossible cascade frozen mid-air—pomegranate seeds, pearls, tiny paper masks, bees made of wax, grains of sand that look like miniature faces, and a few delicate anatomical fragments (a porcelain heart, a glass ear, a silver tongue) that read as offerings or wounds depending on the viewer. The “music” is visible as suspended debris and threads: dust motes arranged like constellations of fingerprints, hair-thin strings stretched between tomb columns like a spiderweb harp, broken mirror slivers levitating in a perfect chord, each mirror reflecting a different person standing where the musician should be—yet none show a face, only a blank oval of light. Midground and background are densely populated with ambiguous bodies and presences: artisans with bandaged heads and mannequin limbs paint masks onto each other’s backs; a nude figure lies on a worktable like a model or a patient, covered not by shame but by a quilt of translucent masks; faceless children made of clay carry lanterns shaped like skulls; skeletal hands (no arms) reach from wall niches to adjust the musician’s strings; an invisible second performer is implied by a cloak hovering on a chair, a footprint pressed into sand with no owner, and a cup of water rippling with unseen breath. Compassion (healing warmth) is the dominant atmosphere: amber light from kilns and oil lamps pools like honey, softening the necropolis stone; gentle hands apply gold to cracks in pottery and to fissures in a carved coffin-lid, as if repairing grief itself; even the serpents’ coils read as an embrace. Fill the corners with layered puzzles—hanging masks that resemble drying faces, inscriptions that look like lullabies or curses, small offerings tucked into skull eye-sockets, a loom weaving funeral shrouds into bridal veils, sand dunes pressing through broken arches like time trying to reclaim the room—everything frozen at the precise instant before the next note would make it all collapse or finally heal.
