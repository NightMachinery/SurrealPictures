Vertical 2:3 composition, viewed from a cramped lower balcony carved into a crater rim: the viewer is half-kneeling behind a corroded railing, looking sharply upward through a curtain of hanging foreground clutter—strings of porcelain teacups, torn silk menus, dried lunar blossoms, tiny bells, tea strainers, prayer beads—so close they blur and partially eclipse the scene, creating layered occlusion and a claustrophobic frame. Beyond them rises the lunar tea district: a dense, labyrinthine amphitheater of terraces and kiosks chiselled into the crater walls, stacked stairways, arched bridges, pressurized glass pavilions, steam vents, collapsed awnings, empty tables set for guests who never arrived; every surface is littered with intimate remnants (lipstained cups, abandoned shawls, cracked mirrors, scattered coins, a single glove, wilted garlands, spilt sugar like moon-dust), suggesting abandonment without explaining it. Dominating the center in extreme low angle, the Ferryman stands on the highest ledge of a monumental teahouse-gate, towering and myth-heavy, androgynous and weathered, bare feet dusted with pale regolith, a heavy cloak slipping from one shoulder to expose vulnerable skin marked by faint scars and tea-stain shadows; their posture is both burdened and gentle—head slightly bowed as if listening to someone who isn’t there, one hand open in a quiet offering, the other gripping an oar that doubles as a ceremonial staff. Behind them, integrated into the architecture, a large Faravahar is physically present as a worn bas-relief/winged disk set into the gate’s stone and also echoed as a faint luminous “halo” formed by aligned lanterns and cup-rings—recognizable yet ambiguous, like a memory trying to take shape. At the Ferryman’s side, a cornucopia is real and tangible: a horn-shaped vessel/teapot with ornate seams, wedged into the balustrade like a sacred tool, overflowing not with fruit but with small charged objects—seeds, pearls, teeth-like sugar crystals, keys, folded paper boats, pomegranate arils, tiny moons—suspended mid-spill. The defining impossibility is “solid liquidity”: tea, steam, and spilled water behave as weight-bearing solids in a frozen dream moment—an arcing pour of amber tea has hardened into a translucent bridge that spans open air between terraces; droplets hang like polished beads that cast warm light; steam from kettles extrudes as rigid ribbons that coil into stair-rails; a thin sheet of “liquid” clings to the air like glass cloth, supporting a fallen chair and a drifting sleeve. Encode time as a collage of repeated phases: subtle, semi-overlapping echoes of the Ferryman appear in three or four offset positions (hand reaching, hand withdrawing, cloak slipping, eyes opening), and a single cup is shown in sequential beats along its fall, each phase crisp and deliberate, implying motion while everything remains perfectly still. The mood lighting must contradict the desolation with compassion: a healing warmth radiates from lanterns, hearths, and the amber solid-tea bridge—soft golds and rose-ambers pooling around abandoned places—while cold lunar blues press in from shadowed crater stone; the Ferryman is rim-lit by both, as if held between tenderness and dread. Pack the corners with micro-stories that refuse to resolve (a door ajar with no interior, a mask reflected where no face should be, a small boat-shaped tray moored to nothing, footprints that start midair and end at the cornucopia), no readable text, no empty sky, every depth plane crowded and intentional.
