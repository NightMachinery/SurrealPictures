Vertical 2:3 frame, packed edge-to-edge inside a clockwork orphanage where every wall is a maze of puzzle-doors (jigsaw seams, rotating keyholes, numbered brass plates, mismatched doorknobs, peepholes showing other rooms), gears and pendulums frozen mid-swing; in the foreground, a mythic parent-chef stands utterly still at the center like an altar piece—barefoot on a floor of interlocking clockfaces, strong but exhausted body half-sheathed in a heavy, flour-dusted apron that hangs like a priestly vestment, one arm cradling an ambiguous “child” (could be sleeping orphan, could be a warm loaf wrapped in swaddling cloth, could be a mechanical doll) against their chest, the other hand holding a wilting bouquet whose petals drift upward instead of falling; their face is calm with visible after-cry redness and a faint exhale, relief tangible as if a burden has just been lifted—thick iron clockweights and chains hover weightless around them, slack in midair, no longer pulling; behind and around this still figure, kinetic chaos is frozen at peak velocity: toys, keys, letters, shoes, cutlery, gears, steam, crumbs, and torn puzzle pieces streak in spirals like wind-tunnels, captured mid-flight without blur, implying violent motion halted in a single impossible moment; the core impossibility dominates the midground: a battered soup pot/oven-mouth on a rolling kitchen cart contains an entire night sky—constellations, aurora, and a small crescent moon—yet from the ceiling a “celestial descent” pours down into it like a waterfall of stars and meteor-embers being neatly contained, the cosmos compressing into the pot without overflow; the Tree of Life is physically woven into the orphanage architecture as a branching brass staircase/pipework that grows upward through floors, each branch ending in tiny doorframes and clock hands, while a luminous Faravahar emblem (part carved wood, part mechanical winged gear) hangs above the parent-chef like a suspended sign or halo, its wings made of layered clockwork feathers and its center a mirror that reflects a different room; corners crowded with micro-scenes: orphan silhouettes pressed to peepholes, mirrored pairs of children and mannequins exchanging masks, a door ajar revealing a nursery that is also a pantry, another door opening onto open sky that still fits inside a bottle; warm dawn-like light shafts cut through dust and steam, turning metal to honey and skin to soft gold, making the whole paradox feel tender rather than catastrophic, as if gravity itself has kindly paused.
