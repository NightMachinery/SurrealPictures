Vertical 2:3 frame, long-telephoto viewpoint that compresses space into tightly stacked, crowded planes: a narrow, candlelit therapy studio that is also a stage, seen as if you’re standing in the doorway and the room is too full to breathe. In the center, a mythic figure who is both therapist and dancer hovers a full body-length above the floor—barefoot, spine elongated, one arm extended in a clinical, listening gesture while the other curls in a dancer’s arc; their face is calm but unreadable, eyes focused as if hearing a confession from the air itself. Their clothing is a paradox of vulnerability and authority: an open, immaculate white coat that drifts like a veil around a near-nude torso (tasteful, classical, emotionally charged), pockets spilling small objects of “purity” (a bar of soap carved into a heart, white lilies, a cracked porcelain cup filled with milk, a baptismal shell, a childlike wind-up swan), all suspended mid-spill. Levitation is the defining impossibility: the couch, side table, framed certificates, and even the dust motes float in layered strata; gravity is “paused” at different heights, so teacups hang beside ankles, and a waterfall of therapy notes becomes a ribbon of paper spiraling around the body like a maypole. Behind the figure, enormous Icarus wings are physically present but unsettlingly ambiguous—half-harnessed to their back, half-architectural: feather-and-wax ribs fused into the room’s molding, with wax slowly beading into perfect pearly droplets that never fall; some feathers are stitched with handwritten patient phrases, others singed into lace-like holes. Woven through the air like a ceremonial spine is the Derafsh Kaviani banner: a jeweled, ancient standard that unfurls as a floating sash and also as a curtain dividing the room, its tassels and metalwork hovering in strict symmetry; the banner’s gemstones catch prismatic light and cast playful rainbow shards onto skin, paper, and furniture, turning the scene whimsically bright despite the adult tension. Foreground clutter (tight, readable detail): a hand mirror reflecting an empty chair; a bowl of sugar cubes orbiting like planets; a ring of keys shaped like tiny bones; a stethoscope used as a garland; a ballet shoe filled with salt; a sealed envelope sweating condensation; a small toy crown dissolving into bubbles. Midground: multiple chairs face different directions as if several sessions are happening at once; a metronome floats open, its pendulum held mid-swing; a glass of water forms a suspended sphere with a goldfish calmly swimming through air. Background (still crowded, compressed): a corridor that looks like a backstage wing and a clinic hallway at the same time, lined with doors that are slightly ajar, each emitting a different impossible “pure” light (snow-glow, moon-glow, surgical-white, dawn-pink), and above them a ceiling mural of clouds that appears to be peeling off into real, cottony fragments drifting forward. Corners must be alive with micro-events: lace curtains levitate as if breathing; tiny paper birds fold themselves from blank forms; a halo-like hoop of gauze slowly wraps and unwraps a floating apple without touching it. The entire moment is a frozen dream at the most critical instant—playful absurdity on the surface, but with undertones of confession, longing, shame, tenderness, and impending fall—nothing resolves into a single story, every object suggests a different memory.
