Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded carnival-circus necropolis at “night” where everything is paused mid-breath: phosphor ticket booths glow like bioluminescent aquariums, casting childlike, curious light onto mausoleum façades stitched into striped tents, a carousel built from weathered sarcophagi, and a ferris wheel whose spokes resemble delicate wing-bones; confetti, torn tickets, petals, and small objects (thimbles, coins, feathers, matchsticks, teeth, bells) hang perfectly still in the air as if time has been pinned. In the foreground stands a mythic artisan—tall, tired-eyed, ageless, hands stained with pigment and ash—half-draped in a heavy apron that slips like a classical cloth, posture both tender and burdened, one knee slightly bent as if interrupted mid-step; their fingers hold a chisel and a spool of thread at once, as though they mend stone the way one would mend skin. The defining impossibility dominates the scene: solid things behave like liquid and float—marble pours upward in slow ribbons from cracked gravestones, turning into levitating blocks that drip without falling; a “river” of polished granite flows through the street like water yet keeps its sharp edges, carrying buoyant coffin-lids and circus props that hover just above it; a suspended waterfall of glassy sandstone hangs in midair, frozen in a curling splash around the artisan without touching them. The artisan cradles a real cradle against their chest (not symbolic, physically present), its wood impossibly softened like clay, and carved into its headboard is a clear Faravahar; above and behind them, another Faravahar motif appears as an architectural keystone—part neon, part carved relief—half-submerged in the upward-flowing stone, as if the place itself is trying to remember a faith or a flight. Everywhere are metaphors of silence/pause: a ringmaster’s bell caught mid-swing with no sound, a trumpet whose breath is visible as a frozen, translucent ribbon, a row of open mouths on masks with the “noise” escaping as motionless glass shards, a mime’s white glove hovering inches from a cheek that never gets touched; even candle flames are stopped mid-flicker, and falling dominoes remain tilted in a perfect non-collapse. Fill the corners with unsettling tenderness: a child’s abandoned shoe beside a gravestone prize booth, a bouquet of carnival balloons made of thin funeral veils, a small handprint in phosphor dust on a ticket window, moths perched on glowing numbers, a clown collar draped over an angel statue missing its face, cherub heads used as tokens, a mirror that reflects a different part of the scene than it should. Midground crowds the eye with layered figures and hints—mannequins, mourners, performers, and statues all indistinguishable at a glance—some gently levitating, some half-melted into architecture, all caught in the same suspended instant, inviting conflicting readings of wonder, dread, grief, desire, shame, and comfort; no empty space, deep layered detail from foreground to background, no readable text.
