A vertical 2:3, full-bleed “altar chamber” seen straight-on: a perfectly symmetrical sanctuary like a ceremonial apse, yet every symmetry hides a quiet sabotage (left column is pristine marble, right column is the same marble but veined with hairline cracks that spell unreadable vows; matching candelabra burn, but one flame freezes into glass). Centered on the dais sits a mythic vizier who is also two lovers at once: one body with two faces turned toward each other in near-kiss and near-argument, crowned by a translucent headdress that resembles a dharma wheel—its spokes etched with tiny handprints—hovering slightly off-axis like a halo that refuses to align; their posture is regal but vulnerable, with a white ceremonial sash slipping like an accidental confession, classical nudity implied through exposed shoulders, collarbones, and torso while strategic folds and objects keep the scene sensual but ambiguous. Gravity is violently reversed: the altar’s offerings “fall” upward into the vaulted ceiling—pearls, prayer beads, teeth-like rice grains, wax droplets, torn love letters, feathers, small bells, and shards of mirror all drifting toward an inverted chalice-basin embedded overhead, where liquid gathers as a calm lake on the ceiling and reflects the room upside down. Icarus’s wings are physically present as a half-worn mantle on the vizier-lovers: one wing immaculate, one wing melted and stitched back together with gold thread and bandages, shedding soft feathers that rise like snow; wax runs upward in thin ropes, forming frozen drips that look like candle tears in reverse. The theme of innocence/purity is everywhere but questioned: bowls of milk suspended mid-ascent with ink clouds trapped inside, lilies blooming out of salt, a child’s soap bubbles floating like planets each containing a tiny, unreadable scene, a baptismal font filled with clear water that holds a dark key at the bottom, spotless white masks stacked beside bruised fruit, and a spotless sheet that is too carefully folded to be honest. The atmosphere is mischievous—gleeful trouble in the lighting: prismatic highlights from hidden stained glass scatter carnival-colored fragments across solemn stone; small impish attendants (not cute, not demonic—ambiguous) tug at ribbons that pull objects upward, swap halos with blindfolds, and pin stolen feathers into sacred scrolls. Crowd every corner with clues that contradict each other: miniature altarpieces showing the vizier as judge, as bride, as executioner; a rosary tangling with a stethoscope; a cracked hourglass with sand rising; a pair of shoes facing opposite directions; a second dharma wheel carved into the floor like a trapdoor; moths arranged like constellations; a mirror that reflects an empty dais. Depth is layered with occlusions—hanging veils, floating debris, overlapping figures—so the viewer can’t settle on one story, only the frozen instant of an impossible rite where purity, desire, and prankish fate are indistinguishable.
