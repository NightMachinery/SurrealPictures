Extreme low-angle view from the polished marble floor of a vast palace-archive, looking straight up into monumental, overgrown bureaucracy: towering filing-cabinets become buttresses, ledger shelves interlock like cathedral ribs, and countless red-thread records (thick as climbing ropes) crisscross the air in a dense web, tying wax seals, keys, metal tags, and torn pages into drifting constellations; the frame is crowded edge-to-edge—corners stuffed with stacked dossiers, stampers, broken seals, spilled ink, hairline cracks in stone, and clerks’ tools that resemble surgical instruments and jewelry. Center stage, two human figures are mirrored on either side of a razor-thin symbolic divide: a vertical “fault line” made of suspended parchment sheets stitched together by red thread, forming a translucent wall that splits the scene while still revealing silhouettes. On the left, the Dreamer—timeless, heavy-eyed, bare-shouldered, partially nude under a drape of braided red threads and loose pages—stands with a posture that is both surrender and coronation, one palm open in offering; on the right, the Lover—nearly identical yet inverted (wet hair vs. dry, ink-stained vs. clean, gaze lowered vs. gaze lifted)—leans forward as if to accept or forgive, their fingertips almost touching through the paper-thin barrier, creating a charged near-contact that can read as reconciliation, accusation, blessing, or farewell. Forgiveness/grace is made physical: knots in the red threads along the divide loosen midair, untying themselves in a frozen cascade; the released strands bloom into living vines and small luminous organs (seedpods, eyes, hearts, or lanterns—ambiguous), and spilled black ink on the floor rises into a weightless halo that washes into clear water around their feet without erasing the stains on their skin. The defining impossible feature is a blatant scale inversion: above them hangs a colossal cradle the size of a city gate, suspended from the red-thread web like a bureaucratic chandelier; inside that enormous cradle sits a tiny, perfectly detailed replica of the same palace-archive containing miniature versions of the two figures asleep back-to-back, while, simultaneously, a single tiny cradle (toy-sized) rests in the Dreamer’s open hand holding a minuscule, fully alive lion that feels monumentally important. The Derafsh Kaviani is present as a massive banner unfurling from the cradle’s underside—stitched from red threads, stamped parchments, and metal seals, heavy with tassels and gemlike droplets of wax—draping diagonally across the architecture and casting a ceremonial shadow that doubles as the “divide” between the two figures. The heraldic lion appears everywhere at once: carved as repeating crests on cabinets and pillars, alive as a shadow-shape prowling the banner’s folds, and as a lion-headed stamp in the Lover’s hand poised over the Dreamer’s exposed chest where a faint ledger-grid and unreadable case numbers are tattooed like evidence. Lighting and color convey explosive vitality: saturated warm-gold and hot-carmine light bursts from within drawers and between pages like breathing lungs, with sharp gleams on brass, wet ink, and skin; dust motes, petals, paper scraps, and tiny seals float in dense layers to imply motion while everything remains perfectly frozen.
