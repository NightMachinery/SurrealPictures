Vertical 2:3 frame; the viewer is half-hidden behind layered translucent textiles (gauze curtains, embroidered veils, damp silk) that fill the extreme foreground with folds, fringe, beads, and faint silhouettes of watching eyes and fingertips pressing from the other side. Beyond the curtain, a “thanksgiving” gathering has been violently, beautifully *displaced*: a long feast table is split into offset slices that no longer line up, as if the room has been shifted in stacked layers; chairs float a few inches away from the people meant to sit in them; bowls pour their contents into empty air where a floor used to be; doorways open onto unrelated interiors (a chapel apse, a childhood kitchen, a hospital corridor, a ballroom) all occupying the same space. At the exact center, a small impact has just occurred—an unseen thing has struck the table’s heart—and the entire scene is frozen mid-shockwave: concentric ripples travel outward through fabric, liquid, smoke, hair, feathers, candle flames, and even the geometry of the architecture, creating sequential “echo” outlines of hands, cups, fruit, and faces at slightly shifted positions as if time stuttered. The protagonist—“the Friend,” mythic and unmistakably present—stands at the epicenter, turned three-quarters away from us, barefoot on an impossible seam between floor and air; their posture is intimate but unreadable: one shoulder softened in tenderness, the spine braced like someone carrying everyone’s secrets. Their clothing is half-ceremonial, half-unmade (a loosened coat sliding off one arm, layered scarves, a sash like a bandage; tasteful artistic nudity partially revealed where fabric has been displaced), skin marked with subtle traces of other people’s touch (powdered flour, lipstick smudge, healing bruise, gold leaf thumbprint). Their nearest arm is extended toward the viewer through the ripples—palm open, offering and asking at once—an actual open hand motif made literal: a luminous hand-shaped relic hovering just above their palm, or a carved hand mirror with a hollow center that frames whatever it faces. The Simurgh is physically present and woven into the world: a vast bird-form assembled from many things that don’t belong together (feast feathers, pages of gratitude letters, autumn leaves, surgical gauze, lace, spilled wine, broken porcelain), simultaneously a living creature and an architectural ornament—its wings arcing through the background like a stained-glass scaffold, its eyes reflecting multiple contradictory scenes; a few of its feathers drift in the air, each feather containing tiny miniature tableaus of giving/withholding. Gratitude is everywhere but never didactic: hands passing bread that becomes light; a mouth about to say “thank you” with the words visible as moths; a cornucopia tipped over that spills not food but keepsakes, apologies, photographs, seeds, coins, rings, and tiny beating hearts made of pomegranate arils; a cracked chalice refilling itself from tears that never fall; a knife poised to carve something that might be fruit, might be flesh, might be a memory. Crowd every corner: in the midground, intertwined guests in ambiguous gestures (embrace or restraint, prayer or surrender), faces half-obscured by napkins, veils, masks, or turned away; in the background, displaced shadows detach from their owners and gather around the Friend like a second audience; on the ceiling-now-sidewall, candles burn underwater; on the floor-now-sky, plates orbit like moons. Lighting feels explosively alive—warm, saturated, pulse-like, as if the room is breathing—yet threaded with quiet dread in the cooler shadows behind the curtains. No single narrative resolves: every object suggests both comfort and cost, every gesture could be tenderness or farewell, and the frozen ripple implies something immense has just been given… or taken.
