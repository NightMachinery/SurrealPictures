Vertical 2:3 frame, packed edge-to-edge: an everted “room” frozen mid-impossibility, as if a chapel-bedroom has been turned inside-out like a glove—the wallpaper is now on the outside, the beams and stitching of the building’s “inner skin” face the viewer, and the ceiling has folded down into the floor; rugs hang in the air like shed tongues of fabric, chairs cling to the walls at wrong angles, drawers spill their contents upward, and the horizon is replaced by the room’s exposed lining: quilted, anatomical, domestic, unsettling. At the exact center stands the Oracle on a narrow threshold where inside becomes outside, weightless yet immovable: a tall, androgynous figure with a calm, exhausted posture (chin slightly lifted, shoulders heavy, one bare foot on “air,” one on “floor”), wrapped in an inside-out mantle whose seams, labels, and hidden pockets are revealed; beneath it, glimpses of vulnerable skin marked with faint constellation-scars and gold-thread sutures, neither wounded nor intact, like a body remembering another shape. Their face is partially veiled by a translucent membrane and a crown of small keys; eyes closed, but the scene watches for them. In their left hand: a small hearth-fire held impossibly without burning—an open brazier that contains a miniature living room fireplace, complete with mantled trinkets and family-photo frames that have no faces, the flame emitting ecstatic light (honey-gold, opal, rose) that bathes everything in blissful radiance; ash drifts like slow snow, and every ash fleck contains a tiny reflection of a different mouth, a different prayer, a different laugh. In their right hand: an all-seeing eye as a physical object—an ocular reliquary like a glass oculus/window/amulet, iris too detailed, wet-lacquer shine, veins like fine marbling; it stares outward while simultaneously appearing as the room’s only “exit,” and its pupil is a doorway where the same scene repeats but slightly wrong (furniture swapped, hands missing, fire colder), creating a quiet dread under the bliss. Grotesque/uncanny details crowd every corner: mirrors that reflect backs instead of fronts; a chandelier made of knuckles and teacups; stockings drying like flags that are actually turned-out skins of garments; a bouquet of lilies whose stamens are tiny teeth; lace curtains that look like ribcages when the light hits; a clock with no hands but many eyelids; candles that weep salt; a staircase that climbs into a drawer. The “outside” of the room (now visible because of the inside-out inversion) is a night sky pressed close like upholstery—stars arranged like burn holes in fabric—while the hearth-smoke flows inward, spiraling into the Oracle’s mantle seams as if the building is inhaling its own warmth. Foreground: scattered tarot-sized cards with blank faces, broken porcelain, wedding rings threaded onto rosary beads, a single high-heel filled with embers, hairpins like tiny spears, and moths hovering in the ecstatic glow. Midground: half-seen attendants—only hands, shoulders, or silhouettes—emerging from cupboards and behind curtains, offering objects that could be gifts or evidence (a stitched tongue, a warm apple, a sealed letter, a wet pearl), their intentions unreadable. Background: the giant architectural hearth itself—upended and inside-out—so the firebox opens to the room like a mouth, and within its flame the all-seeing eye appears again, faintly, as if the fire is dreaming of watching. Freeze the moment at peak transcendence: everything luminous, tender, and unbearably intimate, yet subtly wrong, as if bliss and horror are the same temperature; no empty space, dense micro-detail everywhere, multiple simultaneous interpretations with no single clear story.
