A dense dune-city interior under colossal woven canopies that sag like the belly of a sleeping beast, the entire scene locked in a single suspended instant: three tall, uneven vertical “panels” within one frame created by hanging tapestries, latticework arches, and braided rope-curtains—each partition revealing a different depth layer of the same city, with strong occlusion and overlapping silhouettes so the eye can never settle. In the central partition, a child-sized monarch stands barefoot on a dais of compacted sand and heirlooms, posture too solemn for their age, swaddled in an overheavy coronation cloak stitched from family garments (wedding lace, military braid, mourning veils, baby blankets), the fabric dragging behind like a lineage; their head bears a crown that looks inherited and improvised at once (coins, teeth, pearls, toy parts), yet the face is impossibly smooth and unreadable—no features, only a faint sheen like polished bone or milk-glass. Above them, the canopy has torn open into a clean, circular wound of night sky, and the child-monarch is mid-descent as if lowered from the heavens by taut, luminous threads that resemble both constellation lines and loom-warp; the threads vanish into the starfield, pulling the cloak upward and freezing sand grains in midair around their ankles. The Dharma Wheel is physically present and unavoidable: a monumental wheel with eight spokes integrated into the dais and the surrounding architecture—part prayer object, part gear—its rim half-buried in sand, half-turned as if it had just clicked a notch; thin ribbons, bells, and knotted cords radiate from its spokes into the city like inheritance lines, tethering objects in the scene (keys, rings, lockets, contracts, a broken music box, a bloodless dagger, a child’s drawing) so they hover at different distances like a family tree made tangible. A Simurgh occupies the upper left partition—not merely a bird but an ancient, composite presence formed from layered feathers that look like hand-dyed textiles and pages of illuminated manuscripts; it perches on a canopy-beam and also seems to be made of the canopy itself, shedding a slow snowfall of feathers and parchment scraps that drift diagonally across all three partitions, some pieces catching starlight, others catching lamplight, turning into ambiguous “blessings” or “debts” depending on how you read them. Populate the city with crowded, faceless witnesses: veiled merchants, dancers, mourners, and soldiers pressed into balconies and stairwells; some faces are blank cloth, some are mirrored, some are replaced by small constellations, and a few heads are turned away in synchronized shame or longing; hands reach out from behind curtains, offering gifts that could be weapons, or demanding touch that could be comfort. In the right partition, a narrow street funnels into distance beneath swaying woven roofs; suspended laundry becomes banners, banners become bandages; a procession of carrying poles bears a massive, empty throne like a coffin, and the sand beneath it is printed with repeating footprints that don’t match any visible feet. In the left partition, an intimate interior cutaway glows warm: a half-nude classical statue has been repaired with stitched fabric skin, and behind a screen two adult silhouettes embrace or wrestle—unclear which—while a child’s toy boat floats through the air between them, propelled by no wind. Throughout the frame, layer whimsy into dread: paper lanterns shaped like organs, balloon-animals made of gold leaf, fish swimming through dust motes, tiny crowns perched on stray cats, a marionette with severed strings drifting upward toward the star-wound; everywhere, small personal relics orbit the central figure as if gravity has become memory. Lighting and color should carry playful absurdity and aching distance simultaneously: warm amber from street lamps and candle braziers below, cold celestial blue from the canopy-tear above, with the child-monarch caught exactly where those lights meet—rim-lit, unreachable, and heavy with borrowed history; no empty sky or blank sand anywhere, every corner filled with tangled textiles, suspended debris, inscriptions, knots, and hidden faces that might be masks, might be voids.
