**Aspect ratio 2:3 (vertical).** A crowded desert caravan avenue at dusk beneath layered woven canopies that sag like stitched parchment and billowing pages; the air is thick with suspended sand, ink-dust, and tiny glittering fragments like confetti caught mid-fall, everything frozen at the peak of an impossible event. In the center, a **gigantic Librarian**—mythic, timeless, and weary-victorious—kneels between the caravan stalls like a colossus in a narrow street: one bare shoulder slipping from a severe, timeworn robe stitched from catalog cards and faded book cloth, skin marked with faint stamp-impressions and hairpins shaped like quills; their expression is tender and unreadable, eyes fixed on something both mourned and won. Their hands hold a **small, battered book** whose pages open into a **vast internal desert** (a nested world), while the real avenue below is cluttered with miniature caravans, merchants, readers, and masked figures moving in implied procession—yet all motion is paused: scarves mid-whip, beads mid-spill, a cup mid-tip, a kiss almost-touching, a tear almost-falling. The canopies above are tethered by braided cords that are unmistakably a **friendship bracelet** enlarged into architecture—color-faded threads, missing beads, knots like remembered promises—looping around the Librarian’s wrist and disappearing into stall frames like veins. A torn, luminous **Derafsh Kaviani** banner is physically present, not symbolic-only: it hangs diagonally through the upper third of the frame, stitched into the canopy layers, heavy with jewels and scraps of cloth that look like trophies and shrouds at once, glowing as if lit from within; its tassels freeze mid-sway like a halted victory hymn. In the midground, hovering impossibly low over the avenue, the **Ship of Theseus** appears as a fractured, partially rebuilt vessel made from mismatched planks—some are boat-wood, some are book spines, some are drawer fronts from old card catalogs—held together by sutures of twine and sealing wax; it is both ship and library, with tiny doorways and ladders on its ribs, and its shadow falls across faces like a memory you can’t place. Scatter the entire frame with nostalgic debris that reads as intimate but not literal: pressed flowers in glass, Polaroid corners without images, keys that don’t fit, cracked spectacles, ticket stubs, hair ribbons, half-erased marginalia drifting like moths, and little nameplates with dates scratched out and rewritten. Lighting and color must carry **triumph braided with melancholy**: a radiant, almost celebratory gold pouring through canopy gaps like stage-light, while cool blue-violet shadows pool in folds and under eyes; the scene should feel like the instant after a win that cost too much. Fill every corner: foreground crowded with tiny footprints in ink, spilled beads, miniature figures carrying oversized letters, and a mirror shard reflecting a different sky; background dense with stalls that resemble open drawers, hanging rugs printed with unreadable calligraphy, distant silhouettes frozen mid-gesture, and dunes that look like stacked pages—no empty horizon, no empty sky—everything a richly layered puzzle that suggests many stories and confirms none.
