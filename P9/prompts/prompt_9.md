Vertical 2:3 frame, a cathedral kitchen so crowded it feels alive: ribbed vaults and flying buttresses made of braided bread, marzipan columns with bite-marks, caramel arches sagging like soft fruit, stained-glass windows rendered as translucent hard candy casting prismatic shards across a tiled floor of chocolate and cracked porcelain; everything is caught mid-event in a frozen hush—crumbs, flour, steam, glittering sugar-dust, broken candy “glass,” droplets of ink-black syrup and bright jam hang suspended in the air like a paused explosion. Centered beneath a wedding canopy that hovers like a sacred chuppah and a kitchen tent at once—stitched from lace-thin sugar, veils, napkins, and torn vow-pages, held up by four ambiguous attendants (half-saint, half-baker, half-lover), their hands frozen in the act of lifting—the Vessel stands as a mythic, timeless presence: an androgynous figure with classical proportions, bare skin partially wrapped in an apron of hymn-paper and translucent dough; their posture is both offering and bracing, chin lifted, one shoulder exposed, the body subtly cracked like glazed ceramic. Their torso is impossibly hollowed like an amphora or reliquary, and inside it a small, bright carnival of “joy” is trapped—spinning toy tops made of fruit pits, tiny laughing masks, a ribbon of confetti-like petals, bubbles of light rising like champagne—yet the joy reads as either liberation or containment depending on the viewer. In their hand (or resting against their open ribs) is a poisoned apple: waxy, jewel-red with a bruise-green sheen, beaded with dew that looks like tears, a thin gold needle half-visible under the skin, black honey seeping from a delicate puncture; its reflection repeats the canopy and the figure in miniature, like a cursed mirror. The ovens are everywhere, embedded into the cathedral walls like planets in stone—round mouths glowing with molten sunrise, each oven-door a small orbit, casting violent warm light that collides with the cold candy-stained light from above; hanging cookware forms constellations, ladles and knives arranged like playful mobiles and threatening halos. Edible architecture is unmistakably broken: a giant unseen bite has been taken out of an altar-counter; a cherub-like kitchen statue is mid-chew on a pillar; an archway is being eaten from within, revealing soft cake crumb under hard icing, while sacred tiles melt into frosting at the edges. Foreground clutter: spilled goblets, cracked plates, rings embedded in dough, a bouquet of utensils tied with bridal ribbon, game pieces carved from bread, a childlike hopscotch pattern dusted in flour that leads directly toward the apple; corner details hide double meanings—tiny doors in the bread-columns, a veil snagged on a hook like shed skin, a laughing mouth-shaped oven, a handprint in icing, a wedding bouquet that might be a funeral wreath. Midground and background teem with half-readable figures and gestures—hands almost touching, masked faces watching, someone holding the canopy pole like a torch, someone else reaching to taste a wall—so the scene can be read as celebration, sacrifice, feast, or confession; no empty space, no clear single narrative, only dense, paradoxical vitality and the sensation of remembering a dream you never had.
