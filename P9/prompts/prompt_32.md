A vertical 2:3 frame packed edge-to-edge: at the center stands a single mythic figure whose identity cannot settle—one half dressed as a virgin bride (translucent veil, bare feet, a simple ring of wildflowers pressed to the sternum), the other half as a widow (heavy black shawl pinned with a lock of hair, damp hem like it has trailed through funerary water); she is shown in strict backlit silhouette, head slightly bowed yet chest offered forward, and the backlight turns her outline into a dark cutout while a dense halo of objects crowds around her like a reliquary exploded in midair (keys, rosary beads, torn invitations, lullaby sheet-music, dried roses, broken teacups, tiny shoes, needles and thread, small votive candles, orphaned gloves, brass nameplates). The impossible event is blatant: the world is inside-out—an entire town-square pavilion and nearby row of houses are turned outward like inverted pockets, with wallpaper, bedrooms, staircases, kitchens, and private altars exposed on the exterior façades, while the “outside” brick and roof shingles fold inward and hang in the air like organs; streets braid through the sky as if they were intestines of architecture, and lantern light flows through them the way blood would. The theme of belonging/community is everywhere but never literal: dozens of ambiguous figures (neighbors, lovers, elders, strangers, masked celebrants) appear in overlapping micro-scenes across foreground/midground/background, each partially hidden by drapery and latticework—hands reaching for hands through windows that are now on the outside, people stitching a single enormous communal quilt that is also a map, a circle of dancers whose shadows connect into one continuous chain, a crowd holding the same thread that runs into the protagonist’s mouth like a vow, a few figures drifting alone yet tethered by ribbons to the group; no one’s face is fully readable, and relationships can be read as tender, coercive, protective, or predatory depending on the viewer. Lantern-festival totems dominate the air: hundreds of paper lanterns float upward but are frozen mid-rise, some shaped like hearts, some like wombs, some like empty masks; a few lanterns are trapped inside glass jars carried by unseen hands; one enormous lantern is held by the central figure like a sacred burden, and its warm glow reveals that it contains a skull suspended as if weightless—its eye sockets filled with tiny festival lights, jaw slightly open as though singing; elsewhere skulls recur as architectural keystones, as a bowl of offerings, as a child’s papier-mâché mask, as a shadow on a curtain, never the same twice. The atmosphere is wonder with a childlike brightness: dawn-sky gradients, soft luminous haze, glittering dust motes, confetti, moths, petals, and ash all hanging motionless; reflections multiply in puddles and mirror shards so the scene repeats itself with small changes, hinting at mirrored pairs and alternate readings. Corners are busy with unsettling tenderness—an abandoned pram filled with lanterns, a wedding cake collapsing upward into birds, a mourning wreath sprouting fresh fruit, a small doorway in the ground opening to a crowded room, an open book whose pages are blank except for fingerprints—everything paused at the exact instant before it becomes either celebration or catastrophe.
