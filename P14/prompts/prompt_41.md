Vertical 2:3 composition: On a narrow canal bridge at dusk, a weary courier in a rumpled coat is mid-snip with tiny silver scissors, cutting the twine around a bundle of stamped postcards strapped to their back. The instant the cord gives way, the cards flare open like hinged wings and begin folding themselves into a steep, impossible staircase that rises straight from the bridge stones into low clouds, tugging the courier’s shoulders upward. Loose letters shake free and become small paper birds, spiraling over the water and pecking at the canal’s rippling surface, which briefly turns to ink. Onlookers freeze mid-step with half-finished gestures, lantern light caught in their widened eyes, while the bridge’s shadow stretches the wrong direction and the first stair treads already erase the mossy cobbles beneath them.
