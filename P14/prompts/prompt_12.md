Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow cobblestone arcade at dusk, a solitary cartographer kneels beside an open suitcase and, mid-stroke, draws a final line on a rolled map spread across the street like a tablecloth. The ink does not soak in; it lifts off the paper as a thin black ribbon and threads itself through the air, looping around doorways and lamp posts. As the ribbon tightens, the buildings respond: shutters blink open like eyelids, and the nearest shopfront folds inward along the drawn contour, becoming a real corridor that recedes into impossible distance. Stray receipts and ticket stubs flutter toward the new passage, sticking to the ribbon like leaves to sap, while startled passersby—blurred as if half-erased—reach for their own edges. Warm lantern light pools against a cool mist, making the moment feel inviting and quietly wrong.
