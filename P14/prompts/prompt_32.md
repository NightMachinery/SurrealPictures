Vertical 2:3 composition: On a rain-slick rooftop above a silent city, a lone tailor in a patched coat is mid-stitch, drawing a needle through a rip in the low-hanging sky as if it were heavy fabric. The thread is pulled from the tailor’s own shadow, which stretches too far and tugs back with reluctant life. As the needle pierces, loose “stars” spill out—not as lights, but as pale moths with ink-stained wings—fluttering in frantic spirals before settling into place along the seam. The immediate consequence is visible: the horizon buckles like a curtain being cinched, tilting chimneys and antennae toward the tear, while rooftop puddles mirror a different city that doesn’t match the one above. A few moths land on the tailor’s fingertips, leaving tiny puncture marks that bead with silver, and the air vibrates with a hush like breath being held.
