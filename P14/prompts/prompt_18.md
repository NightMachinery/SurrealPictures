Vertical 2:3 composition: In a deserted museum gallery just after closing, a lone night guard in a rumpled uniform twists a strange brass key hidden behind the frame of an enormous landscape painting; mid-turn, the painted surface turns liquid and bulges outward like a held breath. The guard leans in, jaw clenched, and pulls on the first step of a tiny staircase emerging from the canvas, and in the same instant the staircase rapidly unfurls into the room, each new step clicking into existence above the polished floor. The immediate consequence: the guard’s own shadow detaches from their boots and begins climbing the fresh steps ahead of them, carrying the guard’s lantern-light as if it were solid. Velvet ropes sag, placards flutter, and fine pigment-dust drifts through the air, glowing in cold emergency lighting and a single pale beam from the high windows.
