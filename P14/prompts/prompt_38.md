In a narrow, velvet-quiet hotel hallway, a tired concierge stands on tiptoe, mid-swipe with a wet brush as they paint over a guest’s name on a small door plaque; the old letters peel up like delicate paper skin and flutter away on their own, drifting toward the neighboring door. The instant the drifting name touches the other plaque, the corridor subtly reorders itself: wallpaper patterns slide sideways, suitcase stickers migrate, and a door that was closed moments ago creaks open to reveal the wrong room beyond—someone else’s neatly made bed, someone else’s perfume hanging in the air. Inside the half-open doorway, the original guest freezes, watching their mirror reflection soften and begin to adopt unfamiliar clothing and posture, as if the building is calmly rewriting who belongs where. Warm lamp-glow pools on the carpet, while the far end of the hall fades into misty blue uncertainty. Vertical 2:3.
