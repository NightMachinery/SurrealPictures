Vertical 2:3 composition: In a foggy dusk street lined with leaning brick façades, a solitary bellmaker stands on a crate, mid-swing as he strikes an unfinished handbell with a silver mallet; the impact tears a visible ripple from the air like a translucent ribbon. The ribbon whips outward in a tight spiral, threading through nearby window frames and lampposts, and the immediate consequence is startling—each place it passes begins to “remember” a different moment: posters peel back into blank paper, puddles rewind into suspended beads, and a passing dog’s pawprint lifts from the mud and hovers, trembling. The bellmaker’s face shows conflicted relief and dread, as if he has finally found the note he wanted and now fears what it summons. A few onlookers freeze with half-raised hands, their shadows behaving a heartbeat late, while the streetlight glow bends subtly toward the ringing air.
