A cartographer stands on a wobbling stool in a cramped attic, mid-swipe with a pale eraser across a sprawling wall map whose ink lines shimmer like wet thread; as the coastline vanishes under their hand, the erased space immediately becomes real—cool white fog pours out of the paper and spills into the room, curling around trunks, teacups, and stacks of yellowed letters. The cartographer’s other hand tries to pin the map down, but the parchment buckles and breathes, tugging toward the open skylight where dusk presses in. Tiny compass roses detach from the map and drift like moths, landing on the cartographer’s sleeves, marking them with new directions they didn’t choose. With every second, the fog thickens, lifting loose objects a finger’s width off the floor, as if the missing place is demanding to be entered now.
