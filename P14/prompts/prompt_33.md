Vertical 2:3 — In a seaside laundromat at midnight, a flour-dusted baker in a rumpled apron leans into a front-loading washer mid-spin, gloved fingers hooked around something impossible: a dense, slow-moving cloud being tugged from the drum like wet wool. As it clears the door, the cloud exhales a sudden gust of cold, and the hanging white sheets snap outward, each one swelling into a translucent “window” that shows a different dawn—pink harbors, green storms, a sun rising backward—while puddles on the tile floor briefly reflect those alternate skies instead of the room. A startled customer freezes with a basket half-raised, socks and shirts hovering in the air as if caught in the same breeze. The lone fluorescent tube flickers, mixing harsh light with moonlit mist, making the ordinary machines feel politely alive and slightly offended.
