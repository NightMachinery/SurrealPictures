Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow attic corridor lit by a single swinging lamp, a solitary mapmaker kneels mid-action, stitching a torn shadow back onto the floor with a silver needle and luminous thread. The moment freezes as the final pull tightens—yet the shadow refuses to obey, bulging upward like a soft tide and forming a small doorway where no doorway exists. From the seam, tiny paper moths pour out, fluttering toward the ceiling and leaving pinpricks of cold light in their wake, as if the room is being quietly perforated into night. Rolled charts drift in slow orbit around the mapmaker’s shoulders, their inked coastlines subtly rearranging themselves with each flutter. Dust hangs like powdered hush, and the lamp’s arc throws the scene between warmth and unease, suggesting the corridor is deciding what is real.
