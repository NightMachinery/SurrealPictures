Vertical 2:3, at twilight on a rain-slick rooftop, a solitary archivist in a rumpled coat leans over an enormous book opened across the tiles like a trapdoor, tugging a single luminous thread from its cracked spine; the thread is caught mid-pull, and the surrounding pages are already lifting, folding themselves into a spiraling stair of floating sentences. As the first step clicks into place, letters flake off and become pale, breathing moths that circle the archivist’s shoulders and drink the noise from the streets below, so a distant argument continues with moving mouths in absolute hush. Chimneys bend inward like curious necks, laundry lines straighten into neat musical bars, and gutter water turns to ink that crawls back toward the book in thin, purposeful rivulets. A crescent moon hangs low with a torn-paper bandage, while warm windows glow beneath a fog that feels equal parts relief and uneasy responsibility.
