In a narrow city courtyard that rises impossibly upward through open rooms and balconies, a lone seamstress stands on a rooftop, mid‑stitch, repairing a torn patch of night that hangs on a clothesline like heavy cloth. She pulls the glowing thread with both hands, and the rip widens into a slow, deliberate opening; at once the cobblestone street below begins to unroll in a single curling strip, exposing a dark, quiet sea where the ground should be. The nearest pedestrians freeze mid‑step as their shoes touch the new waterline and turn translucent, their footprints swimming away as small fish made of reflected streetlight. Neighbors lean out with thimbles and mismatched buttons, unsure whether to help or hide, while a cat on the ledge calmly offers scissors in its mouth. The air is warm and hush‑charged, lit by amber windows and a bruised, deepening horizon.
