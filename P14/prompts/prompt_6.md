On a slanted rooftop above a cramped old quarter, a seamstress in a soaked coat anchors a needle between her teeth and tugs a pale thread she has just teased out of the night sky. The strand goes taut; constellations slide toward her like stitched sequins, and the moon’s light gathers into a loose knot hovering at the thread’s end. Below, the city’s shadows begin to obey the new stitch: a bell tower’s silhouette is pulled across the cobbles, sewing itself into the shape of a doorway, while a startled cat is halfway through that dark opening—its tail still in the street, its front already in a different angle of dusk. Wind carries torn playbills upward like curious moths, and every window reflects a slightly delayed version of the moment, as if the world is being hemmed in real time. Vertical composition, 2:3.
