Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow upstairs room, a weary seamstress stands on a chair, mid-stitching a jagged rip that has opened across the ceiling like torn fabric; her needle is halfway through, and the silvery thread is pulled taut between her fingers and the crack. As she yanks to tighten the seam, tiny stars and paper-dry moths spill out of the gap and tumble downward, landing on the table where they instantly fold themselves into crisp origami birds, beating their wings in frantic silence. The wallpaper’s floral pattern subtly unravels toward the tear, as if the room itself is coming undone to follow the escaping sky. A tipped teacup drips upward in slow defiance, catching starlight on each rising drop. Outside the tall window, streetlamps glow through fog, making the whole scene feel gently wrong—tender, urgent, and almost dreamlike.
