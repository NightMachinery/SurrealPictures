Vertical 2:3 composition: On a midnight rooftop above a sleeping city, a young cartographer crouches over a chalky crack running across the sky like a split seam, tugging a thin silver thread out of his own shadow and hurriedly stitching the tear shut mid-pull. His face is calm but strained, eyes fixed on the needle as the thread bites into darkness. The immediate consequence is uncanny: the shadow he is unraveling begins to stand up behind him, gaining volume and posture, then steps away on its own—quietly collecting his dropped footprints like loose coins and stacking them at the roof’s edge. Around them, pinned maps curl as if exhaling, rooftop puddles hold upside-down constellations that no longer match the heavens, and distant streetlights glow too warmly for the hour. The air feels weightless, as though one more stitch could lift the entire city.
