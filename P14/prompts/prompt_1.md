Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow cobblestone lane at dusk, a raincoat-clad cartographer kneels mid-action, looping a glowing thread pulled from the crescent moon around the lowest step of a staircase that has erupted from an overstuffed suitcase and is still unfolding upward on its own, as if trying to escape. The moment the knot tightens, the nearest puddle trembles and flips like a page of water, revealing a sunlit orchard beneath its surface; a second puddle turns to a snowfield, and the reflections no longer match the alley. The cartographer’s compass spins wildly in their open palm, tugged by the impossible directions, while wind lifts loose map corners from the suitcase and pins them to the air like startled birds. Warm windowlight battles a cold, star-silver haze, making the scene feel playful, urgent, and quietly ominous.
