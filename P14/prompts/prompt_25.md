Vertical 2:3 composition: In a rain-slick alley between sleeping shops, a lone cartographer kneels mid-motion, unzipping the edge of her own shadow as if it were a suitcase. From the dark opening she tugs a damp parchment that keeps growing, and where it drags across the stones the alley is already transforming into a miniature coastline—tiny cliffs rise from brick, saltwater pools collect in puddles, and doorways become crooked piers. Her compass needle spins wildly in her palm, drawn toward the unfolding shore, while a startled cat leaps back as a wave made of ink curls toward its paws. Overhead, clotheslines sag like horizon lines, and windows reflect strangers walking a few seconds out of sync. The air feels hushed and heavy with ozone, lit by cold moonlight fractured through dripping awnings, as if the world is being redrawn in real time.
