Vertical 2:3 composition: At dusk in a narrow rooftop neighborhood, a lone street musician stands on a leaning balcony, mid-bow, having looped a single violin string up into the low-hanging moon like a spool; the next note is about to snap it tighter. The instant consequence is already unfolding: pale moonlight pours down the taut line in a visible stream, flooding the alley below so fast that shadows peel off their owners and slide away across the cobblestones like spilled ink. Startled residents freeze in doorways as handwritten words lift from open envelopes and drift upward, drawn toward the glowing string, folding themselves into tiny paper birds mid-flight. Chimneys bend slightly toward the light as if listening, laundry flutters like nervous flags, and the air is sweet with rain that hasn’t fallen yet—playful, luminous, and quietly wrong.
