A weary rooftop seamstress is caught mid-stitch as her shadow, freshly unfastened from her heels, scrambles up a sagging clothesline like a frightened animal; she lunges forward, needle suspended, trying to tack it back before it slips over the edge. The instant the thread bites, the shadow wrinkles and splits into two smaller silhouettes that scamper in opposite directions, tugging the laundry into impossible shapes—shirts billow into sails, socks inflate into hot-air balloons, and a bedsheet briefly becomes a doorway showing a warm room that isn’t there. Below, window lights flicker in sympathy, as if the whole building is holding its breath. Night air is thick with moths orbiting the streetlamps like slow sparks, and the moon hangs too low, watching the outcome of this quiet chase. Vertical 2:3.
