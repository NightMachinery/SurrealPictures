Vertical 2:3 composition: In a deserted velvet theater, a small clockwork fox in a torn usher’s cap is mid-tug on a loose silver thread hanging from the main curtain, its gears straining as the fabric begins to peel away like a sticker from reality. The immediate consequence is visible at once—behind the curling curtain, the “backstage” is not scenery but a deep cavity of floating doorways, each doorway showing a different impossible room where dust drifts upward and chairs face the wrong direction. The fox’s pulled thread continues into that void, stitching the air into ripples that bend the proscenium arch, making the balcony rails soften and sag as if warmed wax. Scattered programs on the aisle lift and orbit the fox like timid moths. Light comes from a single aisle lamp and a cold, unplaceable glow leaking from the revealed space, casting long, uneasy shadows that feel almost alive.
