Vertical 2:3 composition: In a cramped watchmaker’s shop at closing time, a solitary watchmaker leans over the counter, mid-turn of a brass key in a battered wall clock. The moment the key clicks, the clock’s face loosens like a lid and a soft draft of warm light spills out, lifting loose receipts and dust into slow, deliberate circles. He instinctively cups a fallen sparrow in his free hand, shielding it as the shop’s shelves quietly slide a few inches sideways, aligning into a corridor that shouldn’t fit. The sparrow’s heartbeat sets the pendulums around the room swaying in sympathy, and each swing erases a strip of the ordinary floor, revealing shallow water underneath that begins to lap at his boots. Outside the window, the street remains normal, but his own reflection is already walking down the impossible corridor, beckoning without urgency.
