Vertical 2:3 composition: In a quiet canal-side market at dusk, a weary clockmaker kneels on wet cobblestones, holding a pocket watch whose glass has cracked into a tiny doorway. Mid-action, he pours a thin thread of molten gold from a ladle into the fracture, and the gold refuses to harden—curling outward as shimmering letters that drift like fireflies. The immediate consequence is unsettlingly gentle: every nearby stall sign silently peels off its own meaning, turning blank, while the canal water rises in slow, obedient waves to spell the same drifting script before dissolving again. A stray cat watches from inside an empty fish crate, its reflection arriving a heartbeat late. Warm lantern light battles a cold blue mist; the air tastes like metal and oranges, and the whole street seems to hold its breath for the watch to decide what time becomes.
