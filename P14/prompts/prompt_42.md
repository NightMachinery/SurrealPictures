Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow canal-street at dusk, a lone cobbler stands on a wobbling ladder, mid-reach, pulling a bright copper shoelace straight out of his own chest like a stubborn thread, trying to lace shut a widening tear in the cobblestones; as he yanks, the street buckles and folds upward like fabric, and tiny doorways tumble open along the new creases, spilling miniature rooms into the open air. His face is calm but strained, as if pretending the impossible is routine, while bystanders—faceless mannequins in raincoats—hold their breath, fingers hovering near the gap without touching. In the background, a silent carousel drifts half-submerged in the canal, its horses replaced by empty coats that sway as if inhabited. Soft amber streetlamps glow through fog, casting long, uneasy shadows that point the wrong way.
