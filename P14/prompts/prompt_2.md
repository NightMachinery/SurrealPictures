Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow twilight alley, a solitary tailor in rolled-up sleeves kneels beneath a leaning lamppost, stitching the edge of his own shadow to the cobblestones with a luminous thread; the needle pauses mid-pull as the seam tightens and the shadow begins to peel upward, transforming into a dark staircase that climbs the air. One foot is already lifted, caught between staying and stepping onto the first impossible stair, while the tightened thread tugs at his jacket like a gentle hand and also like a trap. Behind him, doorways have no handles, only softly breathing keyholes; windows tilt as if listening, and distant rooftops bend toward the stair’s ascent. Dust motes hang like tiny paused thoughts in the lamplight, and the alley’s silence feels tender, inviting, and slightly wrong.
