Vertical 2:3 composition: On a storm-battered cliff, an aging lighthouse keeper is mid-turn on the heavy brass wheel that swivels the great lens, his sleeves soaked and hair whipped sideways by wind. The beam slices through salt fog and, where it touches the black sea, the water stiffens into translucent steps—each new sweep locking another staircase segment into place. Below, a small fishing boat has just begun to climb the impossible stair, its bow lifted and nets trailing like wet hair, while the wake behind it remains liquid and furious. A lantern inside the tower flickers warm against cold moonlight, casting doubled shadows that don’t quite match the keeper’s posture. Sea birds hang in the air as if pinned to invisible threads, and scattered shells on the rocks subtly point toward the ascending boat, as though the shoreline itself is quietly directing the escape.
