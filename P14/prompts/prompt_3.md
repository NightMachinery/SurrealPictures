A tall 2:3 vertical scene: in a narrow canal street at blue-hour dusk, a weary night-watchman in a raincoat stands on a stone bridge mid-action, tugging a glowing thread he has pulled from the hanging streetlamp above. The thread unspools like liquid light into his cupped hands, and as it tightens, the lamp begins to unravel—its glass shell peeling away into drifting fireflies and tiny paper-thin numbers. The immediate consequence happens now: the watchman’s shadow on the wet cobbles is being yanked upward by the same thread, stretching, thinning, and tearing free from his feet into a flock of dark birds that scatter toward the rooftops. Onlookers behind shuttered windows press their palms to the panes, their own shadows lagging a heartbeat late, uncertain whether to follow. Mist curls along the water, and the air feels hushed, as if sound is holding its breath.
