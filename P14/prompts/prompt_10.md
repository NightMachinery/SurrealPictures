Vertical 2:3 composition. At dawn on a high-rise scaffold, a lone window cleaner drags a squeegee down the glass; the streak he wipes away reveals not an office but a quiet sea-room behind the pane, complete with drifting kelp shadows and a slow, sunken chandelier. Mid-swipe, a pale fish the size of a briefcase bumps the window from the inside, and the impact beads saltwater on the cleaner’s glove, soaking his rag and making the soap bucket at his feet brim with tiny seashells. A paper cup of coffee trembles beside a forgotten hard hat as his breath catches, fogging the pane in a wavering oval. He freezes, one boot slipping on the wet plank, while below the street continues in muted normality—cars, umbrellas, steam—unaware that a tide line is rising within the building. Soft morning light, misty air, faint reflections mixing city and ocean, whimsical yet unsettling calm.
