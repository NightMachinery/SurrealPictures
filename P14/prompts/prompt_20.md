Vertical 2:3 composition: On a foggy tram platform at dusk, a solitary seamstress in a raincoat yanks a single loose stitch from her own sleeve, mid-pull, eyes wide with stubborn calm. The thread doesn’t snap—it keeps coming, glimmering like a thin ribbon of moonlight, and as it slides across the air it catches the edge of a weathered wall poster; the printed scene peels away and becomes real, spilling out as a tide of warm sand and shallow water onto the tiles. The immediate consequence is happening now: polished shoes of waiting passengers sink ankle-deep, umbrellas tilt as if unsure whether to shelter from rain or surf, and the tram rails ripple like kelp beneath a transparent wave. Streetlamps refract into floating droplets, casting soft, uneasy halos; distant city silhouettes blur, as though being gently unstitched from the horizon.
