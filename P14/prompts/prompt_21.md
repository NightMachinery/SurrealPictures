Vertical 2:3. In a moonlit attic museum, a lone night curator stands on a swaying ladder, mid-reach, tugging one loose silver thread from a vast wall tapestry that depicts a calm sky. The thread resists like a living filament, and as it slides free, the woven stars begin to unravel into small luminous moths that burst outward and spiral around her face, drawn to the warmth of her breath. The immediate consequence is visible: a ragged hole opens in the tapestry-sky, and real dawnlight pours through it in a narrow beam, cutting the dusty room into two seasons at once—cold blue night behind her, pale morning on the floorboards below. Display cases tremble, labels curl, and her shadow stretches into an impossible staircase leading straight into the new opening, inviting and ominous.
