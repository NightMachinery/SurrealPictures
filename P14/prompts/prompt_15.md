Vertical 2:3 — In a candlelit conservatory at midnight, a solitary botanist in a raincoat unseals a glass bell-jar containing a tiny coastline; as the stopper lifts, the miniature tide surges out in midair, curling around her boots and climbing the ironwork, carrying drifting shells that glow like lanterns. She braces herself against a wrought-iron table while the escaping seawater begins turning the surrounding orchids into salt-crystal anemones, their petals twitching as if breathing. Outside the panes, the city is quiet, but the sky above the roof has begun to ripple with the same tide, as though the room is pulling an ocean through the glass. Suspended droplets catch the candlelight, forming a wavering path toward a distant door that wasn’t there a moment ago; the botanist’s expression hovers between wonder and worry.
