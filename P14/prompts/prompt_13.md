Vertical 2:3 — In a vast glass greenhouse, a lone botanist in rolled sleeves lifts the lid of a sealed terrarium with both hands, face tense with curiosity as condensation beads slide down their wrists. Inside the jar, a thumb-sized thundercloud churns; the instant the lid breaks the seal, the cloud unravels into hundreds of pale moths that surge into the air like spilled weather. Mid-flight, the moths cling to the dangling plant tags and gently tug them free, carrying the tags upward until they hover among the rafters in a loose, readable star-map. The greenhouse reacts as if listening: vine tips twist toward the floating labels, blossoms open a beat too wide, and a shallow puddle on the tiled floor ripples with miniature lightning reflections. Warm sunset light filters through wet panes, turning the scene playful yet quietly ominous, as though the room has learned a new rule.
