Vertical 2:3 composition: In a rooftop greenhouse at twilight, a lone botanist in rolled sleeves kneels beside an old violin pried open like a wooden ribcage, drawing a needle through a seam of silver light to stitch a fresh tear along its belly. Mid-stitch, a rush of tiny seedlings and pale moths pours out together, spiraling upward, and the botanist’s hand hesitates as the first vine curls around their wrist with unsettling tenderness. The immediate consequence: the greenhouse glass fogs from the inside as if something has begun to breathe there, and each hanging bulb fills with muted green radiance, throwing leaf-shaped shadows that creep across the tiles toward the stairwell. Beyond the panes, balconies hover at mismatched heights over a sleeping city, while a rainstorm hangs motionless above the roof, poised to drop the instant the final stitch is pulled.
