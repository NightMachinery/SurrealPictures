Vertical 2:3. At the instant a lone night courier sprints along a rooftop stitched from stacked library ledgers, they flick open an umbrella that unfolds into a tiny proscenium, curtains snapping wide in the wind. Mid-stride, they thrust the handle forward as if presenting the stage to the sky, and the first consequence happens immediately: paper-thin performers spill out, not falling but stepping upward, marching into the clouds where their silhouettes become living punctuation marks that rearrange the moon’s reflection on nearby windows. The courier’s face is half-hidden by the rushing collar—equal parts daring and regret—while behind them a wake of loosened ink drips from the ledgers, forming puddles that briefly mirror scenes the courier never delivered. Narrow alley lights glow honey-warm below, but above, the air turns cool and oddly quiet, as if the city is holding its breath to watch what exits the umbrella next.
