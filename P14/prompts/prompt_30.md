Vertical 2:3 composition: On a narrow rooftop at twilight, a young cartographer in a wind-tugged coat kneels beside an open suitcase of maps and instruments, pulling a single shimmering filament from the throat of a brass compass as if drawing out a secret. Mid-action, the filament whips into the air and begins stitching the clouds into a new route, and the skyline below immediately reacts—chimneys lean toward the thread, streetlamps unspool their light like ribbons, and whole alleys subtly slide sideways to follow the forming seam. A startled flock lifts off, but each bird folds into a crisp paper arrow that points toward the moving stitch-line. The cartographer’s eyes widen with equal dread and wonder as the city quietly reorients around the mistake she can’t stop making, moonlight pooling in the suitcase like spilled ink, the atmosphere playful yet ominously inevitable.
