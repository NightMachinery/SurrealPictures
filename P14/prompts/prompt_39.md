Vertical 2:3 — On a midnight tram stop, a lone cartographer in a raincoat stands mid-action, tugging a silver thread from the seam of her sleeve and feeding it through a needle held like a conductor’s baton; with each pull, the thread stitches itself across the air into glowing map-lines that hover between her hands and the street. The immediate consequence is unfolding now: the nearest lampposts loosen from the pavement as if unfastened buttons, drifting upward to become warm, blinking fireflies that follow the stitched routes. Commuters freeze with tickets half-torn, their shadows sliding off their shoes and pooling like ink at the curb, trying to crawl back into shape. Behind her, the tram’s windows show a normal city, yet the real street around her subtly obeys the hovering lines—shop signs rotate, alleyways bend, puddles ripple into tiny compass roses. Damp fog and sodium light make everything soft, playful, and quietly wrong.
