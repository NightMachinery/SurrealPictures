Vertical 2:3 framing: In a rain-damp alley between leaning apartment blocks, a lone seamstress is caught mid-stitch, pulling a faintly luminous thread from her own ribcage to sew the torn silhouette of a passerby back onto the cobblestones; as the needle bites, the detached shadow writhes like a trapped animal and begins siphoning nearby lantern-light into the seam, making the alley’s perspective bow inward and the bricks ripple toward the puncture point. The passerby’s face holds a strange calm over terror, boots lifting a few inches as if the returning darkness has gained weight and leverage. Puddles mirror upside-down rooms that shouldn’t exist, and a few paper birds hover motionless, pinned by an unseen gravity that intensifies with every stitch. Behind half-drawn curtains, distant windows seem to “watch,” while pale dawn leaks from above, blending with warm lamplight into soft, unsettling halos around the figures.
