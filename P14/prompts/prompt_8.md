Vertical 2:3 composition: On a windy rooftop night market above a sleeping coastal city, a lone street vendor in a patched coat braces himself and cranks a brass music box bolted to the parapet; with each turn, the skyline below bends as if made of soft clay, and dozens of window-lamps loosen into pale moths that spiral upward, stitching themselves into a trembling stairway. Mid-action, the vendor’s fingers slip on the handle as the moth-stair suddenly buckles, and a scuffed suitcase at his feet snaps open, releasing a flock of folded shadows that race after the moths and claw holes through the living steps. The consequence lands instantly: the stair sags toward the street, shedding moth-dust like snow, while the vendor—calm but rattled—must decide whether to keep turning and risk collapsing the city’s shape. Salt fog curls around dangling price tags, distant bells sound muffled, and moonlight turns rooftop puddles into dark, watchful pools.
