Vertical 2:3 framing: In a rain-slick plaza at midnight, a lone cartographer in a soaked coat kneels over a colossal city map inlaid into the cobblestones, urgently rubbing out a painted river with a pumice stone while ink runs down their wrists. As the last dark stroke vanishes, the real river behind them obeys—its water peels upward in a single smooth sheet, hovering like a translucent ribbon above the rooftops, heavy with suspended droplets. Streetlamps glow through the lifted current, casting wavering bands of light across windows and startled faces peering from balconies; paper street signs soften and sag, as if the town itself is becoming editable. The cartographer looks over their shoulder mid-motion, caught between awe and dread, knowing the hovering flood is about to drift sideways and redraw the city in an instant.
