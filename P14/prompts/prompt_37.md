A barefoot archivist stands on a narrow balcony inside an endless municipal atrium, mid-swing of a copper key; she has just unlocked a pane of air as if it were a cabinet door. The invisible door yawns open, and from it spills a procession of tiny rooms—each room complete with furniture—tumbling like dice and landing softly across the tiled floor. As they touch down, they begin to unfold, enlarging into full-size corridors that braid themselves around her ankles, trying to lead her away. She leans back, gripping a ribbon pulled from her own silhouette to tether the newest corridor before it steals her name from the brass label on her chest. Onlookers in distant windows hold their breath; their reflections lag a second behind, watching a different outcome. Pale morning light filters from nowhere, dust motes drifting upward like slow snow. Vertical 2:3 framing.
