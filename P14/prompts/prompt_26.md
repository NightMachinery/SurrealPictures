A lone archivist in a raincoat stands mid-step on a narrow staircase that hangs in open air, leaning forward to pinch shut a runaway whisper that has escaped their mouth and is unfurling into a ribbon of translucent letters; the moment their fingers close, the letters crumple into a fluttering swarm of paper moths that veer downward, landing on the spines of nearby books. Instantly, the touched volumes yawn open by themselves, and tiny dioramas spill out—miniature streets, drifting boats, sleeping faces—hovering like lantern-lit bubbles around the archivist’s head, tugging at their sleeves as if begging to be filed. Below, a floor of shallow water mirrors everything with a slight delay, so the consequences arrive a heartbeat late. The air is warm with dust and thunder, and a distant bell seems to ring underwater.
