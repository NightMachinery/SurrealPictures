Vertical 2:3 composition: In a nearly empty late-night streetcar, a weary ticket inspector leans over a single passenger—an elegant mannequin dressed for winter—mid-action as he clamps his metal punch through a blank fare card. Instead of a hole, the punch releases a fluttering spill of pale paper moths that immediately swarm toward the fogged windows, biting neat crescent cutouts through the glass’s condensation. Through each fresh opening, the outside world changes in real time: rain-slick alleys blink into sunlit fields, distant towers turn into leaning reeds, and headlights become drifting fireflies, as if the streetcar is traveling through incompatible memories at once. The inspector freezes, realizing the moths are stitching the passenger’s shadow to the moving scenery, tugging it outward. Soft sodium light pools on wet seats; the air looks cold enough to taste, playful yet quietly ominous.
