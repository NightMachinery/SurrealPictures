Vertical 2:3 composition: at the instant a lacquered, wood-veined tower with chrome ribs fractures open, a lone captive—wearing round spectacles, a thin lightning-shaped scar at the brow—lunges through the widening seam and catches the wrist of a grinning wanderer in a long coat who has climbed the exterior like it was a staircase. The tower’s keystone is a grinning skull relief, and the split runs straight through its teeth; as the mouth opens, a spill of honey-warm light floods outward, turning dust into drifting fireflies. Gravity has just inverted: a kettle, a blanket, and a ring of keys lift toward the “ceiling” sky, while their boots stay planted, toes straining, as if the world is trying to peel them away. Far beyond the breach, an upside-down city hangs like a mirage over a dark sea, and a gentle giant at the horizon bends closer, curious—its shadow falling upward into the tower, as the escape begins and the prison forgets which way is down.
