A lone young pickpocket stands ankle-deep in a half-flooded royal chamber, mid-heist, tugging a small, luminous ribbon of “promise” from the clasp of an unattended coronation mantle; the ribbon stretches like moonlit taffy, and as it lengthens the room obediently changes—tidewater unspools backward through cracked marble seams, and the chandelier overhead (a constellation of shells and candlebulbs) rises with a gentle inhale, dripping slow, silver droplets that hover instead of falling. Perched on the thief’s shoulders are two elegant, living ornaments shaped like serpentine epaulettes, their eyes half-lidded in watchful calm, as if they’ve seen this bargain before. The thief’s face wears festive bone-and-flower paint, smiling where their mouth is tense, caught between curiosity and warm sadness, staring at the ribbon as though it’s a key to a wish they can finally negotiate.
