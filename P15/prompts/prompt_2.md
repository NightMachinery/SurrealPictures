Vertical 2:3 composition: on a narrow boulevard staged like a late-night opera set, a breathless street performer sprints mid-leap across the cobbles, one boot still dusty and poor while the other already lacquered, as they tug a jeweled collar into place and slide on oversized black sunglasses in the same motion. A small crown slips from their fingers, spinning ahead like a coin, and the instant it leaves their hand their shadow on the wall snaps into a poised monarch with a trailing cape, while their real body remains hunched and ordinary. Above the avenue hangs a single luminous iris-shaped lantern, staring without blinking; its cold beam pins the performer even as they run. Marionettes line the balconies, strings twitching, yet their shadows below are unmistakably human—some reaching toward the fleeing figure, others bowing as if recognizing a ruler. At the far end, a saffron flame burns in a glass shrine, close enough to warm the air, too far to touch, casting long, aching distance through the scene.
