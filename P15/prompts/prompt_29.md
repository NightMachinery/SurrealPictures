Vertical 2:3 composition, extreme low-angle view of a solitary, poised architect standing on a marble plinth in a vast ceremonial bathhouse; rose-colored steam coils around porcelain wall murals that depict a maze whose corridors seem to continue into the room. Mid-action, they perform an impossibly precise tea-serving bow, pouring a thin ribbon of dark tea into a glowing spiral shell held like a chalice; the moment the liquid touches the luminous interior, a quiet chord “appears” in the air as tangible ornaments—tiny brass clefs, tuning pegs, and vibrating strings—forming a dense halo around their backlit silhouette. Immediate consequence: the labyrinth mural’s paths unspool and re-knot in real time, tiles subtly sliding with soft grinding, reconfiguring the exits behind them. Above, a monumental stone lion relief, half-shadowed and regal, seems to inhale the new geometry, its eyes catching the hearth-fire glow from a sunken brazier that flares brighter with each drop. The atmosphere is reverent, serene, and faintly unsettling, as if etiquette itself is rewriting the building.
