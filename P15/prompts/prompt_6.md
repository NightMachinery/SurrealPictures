From a ground-hugging, low-angle viewpoint between oversized gilded filigree, a colossal caretaker kneels at the edge of a layered proscenium-like world where cutout walls and distant streets seem stacked like theatrical scenery; her hair billows into a black weatherfront that crackles with silent lightning. Mid-motion, she slips a sealed, time-worn letter into the hinged “mouth” of a lumbering city-sized walker—an ambulatory bastion whose joints glow with a volatile inner blaze—as if feeding it a confession instead of fuel. The immediate consequence lands in the same instant: the infernal light inside the fortress stutters, then steadies into a gentler ember, and the next lifted foot hesitates, lowering with unexpected delicacy rather than a crushing stomp. Near her palm, a shortened, half-spent candle gutters, its thin flame bending toward the letter as though listening. The air holds creeping unease, but her posture is unmistakably tender, and the sky’s pressure feels just slightly released. Vertical 2:3.
