Vertical 2:3 scene, ultra‑wide lens distortion with gently curving edges: at the brink of a tidal flat that is also a polished ballroom floor, a lone traveler in a weathered coat leans forward mid‑stride, extending an open velvet box toward a stranger made of drifting postcards and threadbare ribbons; inside the box, a tiny clockwork seashell is still unwinding, scattering warm amber motes. The instant the gift nears the stranger’s hands, the traveler splinters into several translucent “earlier selves” arcing behind them like sequential afterimages, each carrying the box a fraction closer, as if one generous act is being replayed and corrected. Above the horizon hang two low suns—one honey‑gold, one pale rose—casting doubled shadows that refuse to align. The world is split-level: an upper shoreline arranged in a subtle radial pattern of shells and footprints, and below it a mirrored underworld where the same pattern blooms into a spiraling ceremonial diagram. Half-buried beside them, a three-pronged sea-spear anchors the scene, its tips catching the motes like reluctant stars, while the air feels tender, wistful, and slightly wrong.
