In a vertical 2:3 scene, a poised clockwork courtier in a dusk garden pauses mid-swing, bringing down a croquet mallet whose handle is a tall pink bird; instead of striking a ball, the beak hits the courtier’s own open torso—an impossible hinged ribcage that yawns like a cupboard. At impact, a hollow in their chest blooms into a warm, pulsing loaf-shaped heart, and the shock makes it tumble onto the grass where it immediately begins to sprout tiny golden teeth, nibbling at scattered crumbs as if starving. The courtier’s face holds a too-wide, passenger-carriage smile, cheerful and predatory at once, while above them an ancient winged sun-emblem rotates slowly, casting feathered shadows that point like arrows toward the fallen heart. In the background, trimmed hedges bend inward as if listening to the vibrating “rib strings,” and guests in lace masks lean closer, hungry for the next note.
