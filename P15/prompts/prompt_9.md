A lone mapmaker in a salt-stained coat sprints along a moonlit jetty, one hand clutching a trembling spool of pale ribbon that unrolls behind him like a living route line, stitching itself to wet planks as if pleading for him to turn back; instead he leans forward, fearless, eyes locked on a towering incoming surge that should swallow the harbor. Mid-stride, his confidence snaps into the world: his boots lighten and begin to lift, toes skimming above the boards, and the ribbon tugs upward like a kite string, pulling him into a hesitant glide. The wave’s front curls, then hesitates—its foam rearranging into contour lines and compass roses, becoming a translucent wall of cartographic symbols that parts just enough to reveal safe passage. From a ship’s lantern, cool blue vapor billows into a half-formed face that softens with reluctant mercy, exhaling over the water so the threat turns gentle, like forgiveness made visible. Vertical 2:3 composition, intimate foreground, vast sky of drifting cloud-maps, soft ominous rim light.
