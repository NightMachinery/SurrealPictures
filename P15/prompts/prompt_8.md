Vertical 2:3 composition: In a moonlit farm clearing at the forest’s edge, a calm, barefoot messenger in a simple ceremonial veil steadies a wooden child’s toy boat in one hand while the other hand unties a cord from the wrist of an ancient tree whose bark forms a watchful face; the instant the knot loosens, dozens of warm paper lights drift upward like escaped prayers, and two small, living serpents uncoil from the messenger’s shoulders to taste the air. The consequence blooms behind them: the horizon fractures into overlapping seasons—ripe wheat, bare branches, spring blossoms—spinning in a silent vortex, while a distant coastal beacon sweeps its white eye across the fields as if searching for the released lights. In the foreground everything is eerily still—dew frozen on grass, the messenger’s breath suspended—yet in the background shadows run backward, clocks melt into bird shapes, and a forbidden door in a hedgerow cracks open, leaking dawn-colored smoke.
