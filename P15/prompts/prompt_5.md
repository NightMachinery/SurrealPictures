In a vertical 2:3 scene, a well-dressed guest stands at the end of a crowded harvest supper table, caught mid-reach as they pry open a thumb-sized door hidden in the carved wall paneling; inside, a softly lit “other room” breathes out warm air and the faint scent of clean linen, inviting like a private life stolen from someone else. In their other hand they cradle a lacquer-gloss crimson fruit meant for the centerpiece, but a chrome carnival pincer dangling from the ceiling cable descends to pinch it away at the exact instant they refuse to let go, knuckles white with quiet defiance. The struggle yanks the tablecloth: candles skid, gravy becomes a slow tidal wave, and place cards flutter like startled birds. An empty chair buckles inward as if an unseen diner has just sat down, and a small ember in the guest’s pocket burns through fabric, painting their shadow with rebellious, dancing light.
