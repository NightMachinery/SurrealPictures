Vertical 2:3 composition: In the heart of a lantern-lit fairground of crooked balconies and ribbon-strung bridges, an aging festival caretaker stands mid-action atop a circular dais, one hand yanking down a pearly blindfold from his own eyes while the other slams a brass lever on a towering spindle-machine that turns like a living carousel. Above him the sky is caught in a dark bite of sun, and the moment the blindfold slips, the painted fireworks and smiling paper-masks around him sag into soggy truth—revealing frayed cables, exhausted dancers, and a narrow prison-tower that had been disguised as a celebration arch. The caretaker’s uncovered gaze turns fierce and lucid; his lever’s strike snaps the machine’s cycle out of rhythm, and the tower’s iron door bursts outward in a spray of dust and confetti. A charismatic outlaw, half in shadow, reaches through the broken threshold toward him as the crowd’s cheers curdle into startled silence, while warm gold and cold ash-blue light collide across their faces.
