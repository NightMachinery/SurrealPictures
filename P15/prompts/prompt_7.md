Vertical 2:3 — In a long ruined arcade that narrows toward a single distant doorway, a lone wayfarer in a rain-damp coat slides one foot forward mid-step, balancing a brass wick-lamp whose honeylight is spilling out as if liquid; with the other hand they strum a pale ivory guitar, and the note visibly ripples through the air, tugging at the light like a ribbon. Their shadow, however, has already slipped off the tiles and is sprinting ahead on its own, reaching back to snatch the escaping glow, leaving the figure’s face half-lit and half-erased. The immediate consequence blooms in the foreground: a fractured marble pillar beside them begins to un-crack—not into stone, but into drifting paper-thin feathers that swirl into a small cyclone around the lamp’s flame, threatening to smother it. Dust motes hang like tiny planets in the beam; the corridor’s receding floor seams pull the eye forward, playful yet unsettling, as if the space itself is listening.
