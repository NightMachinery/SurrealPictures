Vertical 2:3 — In a centered one-point perspective, aggressive depth lines converge along a narrow causeway that looks like a ceremonial carpet unspooling across a stitched-together ocean: to the left, luminous coral shallows; to the right, ink-dark kelp trenches; ahead, a pale shelf of drifting ice, all meeting at a razor horizon where two suns hang like mismatched coins. In the foreground, an anxious parent strides mid-step, eyes fixed forward, cradling a small, sleeping bundle wrapped in ornate cloth; with the free hand they are flipping a glass timer at chest height. The instant the timer turns, its falling grains become tiny barbs, and thorny filaments needle outward into the carpet’s patterns, pinning the weave so it won’t unravel beneath them. Behind the parent, a jeweled, ancient-looking battle standard begins to unfurl from the carpet’s border as if the ornament itself has decided to celebrate, and the parent’s tense jaw breaks into startled, victorious elation—wonder mixed with relief—as the sea is forced to obey the geometry of the weave.
