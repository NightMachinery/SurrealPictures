Vertical 2:3, bird’s-eye diorama view into a dollhouse-sized rooftop room split open like a keepsake box, where one proud figure in ornate festival face paint (bone-white filigree around the eyes, floral accents at the lips) leans forehead-to-forehead with a lover, their hands clasped so tightly the knuckles glow. Mid-action, the painted figure reels a sky-blue kite line from a small wooden spool; the string is braided from both of their hair, and as it tightens it tugs a translucent strip of “memory” from the lover’s sternum like a ribbon being reluctantly pulled free. The immediate consequence: the ribbon unfurls across the tiny room into a hovering, painfully clear scene that the surrounding miniature onlookers react to—some cover their eyes with velvet blindfolds, others climb tiny ladders to stare, while a few offer sweet candies shaped like closed eyelids. Above the open roof, the kite jerks in a gentle wind, casting a haloed shadow that looks like a question mark over them both, in warm dusk light edged with uneasy bluish haze.
