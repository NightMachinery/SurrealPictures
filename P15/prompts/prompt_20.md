Vertical 2:3 — In a glass-roofed winter garden turned dining hall, a lone hostess in mourning-black finery leans over a lavish table, mid-gesture as she twists the cork from an oversized crystal decanter that contains a miniature thunderhead; the instant the seal breaks, a ribbon of honey-colored warmth pours out like breath and coils around a frightened little nest-animal on her platter, half-feather and half-sapling, whose eyes reflect the terror of being swapped for the wind-up duplicates scattered among the cutlery. In the still-life foreground, pears sweat, silver forks sprout tiny leaves, and place cards have become blank cocoons. Behind her, the conservatory’s tall panes bow inward under the pressure of a looming wall of seawater, frozen in a precarious pause by the spreading glow, while a crocodilian silhouette made of clock parts hangs from a chain above, its pendulum slowing as if listening. Dusty sunbeams and stormlight mingle, turning the moment tender, absurd, and quietly catastrophic.
