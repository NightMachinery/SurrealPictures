Vertical 2:3 composition, three-quarter cinematic angle with deep parallax: in a vaulted attic-temple of timber rafters and hanging prayer bells, a single figure stands on a narrow beam mid-lunge, grinning with victorious elation as they wrench a thick braid of their own glowing golden hair up and around the rafters like a winch line. The pull snaps a prismatic arch into existence in the air—an impossible bridge of rainbow light—while the space beyond it repeats itself in smaller and smaller arches, receding into infinite recursion. From the shadowed floor below, cursed tar-black wormlike tendrils surge upward to seize the light, but the moment the bridge locks into place they recoil, knotting into a grotesque, self-devouring spiral that bites its own tail. A white crane darts through the arch carrying a strip of saffron-stained paper; its fluttering ribbon sheds fragrant gold dust that becomes floating calligraphy strokes, circling the figure like a cheering crowd in silence.
