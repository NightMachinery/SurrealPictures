A lone archivist-surgeon in a maze of towering stacks is mid-leap across a spiraling balcony, clutching a cracked, pearl-inlaid book to their chest as they press its cover against the gill-slit of their beloved—an elegant, amphibious royal in torn ceremonial robes—trying to seal the wound before the next breath. The instant the clasp snaps, the book blooms open like a living heart: pages unfurl into vines, ink erupts into bright seedlings, and a warm tide spills out, carrying miniature wreckage—tiny masts, rings, and love letters—around their ankles. Chained world-volumes swing from iron hooks overhead, each atlas absurdly larger than the room, while below, a storm-charred tree grows through the marble floor, its scar still glowing from a recent strike, feeding luminous sap into the flooding water. In the rippling surface, an impossible grin hangs without a face, watching. Moonlight and lightning share the air, soft and ominous; vertical 2:3 composition, gallery-grade detail.
