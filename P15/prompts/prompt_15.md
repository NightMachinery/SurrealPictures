Vertical 2:3 composition: From behind a veil of translucent drapery, the viewer witnesses a quiet rooftop moment turning irreversible—an exhausted traveler kneels on moonlit shingles and, with trembling tenderness, lifts the lid of a palm-sized, ornate casket as if offering it to the only witness who won’t judge. A great white wolf stands close enough that its fur brushes the traveler’s wrist, not snarling but holding its breath, eyes fixed on the opening. Mid-lift, something escapes: a ribbon of light that behaves like both liquid and stone, pouring upward in slow, heavy curls before hardening into a prismatic arch that spans the gap between chimneys, inviting and impossible. The immediate consequence is visible at once—every rooftop pattern below subtly rearranges into a sprawling maze, gutters bending like corridors, window frames sliding into dead ends—while the traveler’s face softens with intimate relief and dawning fear, lit by the new rainbow glow and the cold, single star above.
