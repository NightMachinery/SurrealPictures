Vertical 2:3 composition: In a narrow city corridor where balconies, faces, and storefronts appear unnervingly stacked close together as if distance has been squeezed flat, a broad-shouldered traveler in a crisp waistcoat braces her feet and lifts a heavy collar of interlocking brass rings up from her throat, mid-heave, jaw clenched but eyes calm behind dark lenses. Seven thumb-sized workers—part seamstress, part miner—cling to ladders and pocket scaffolds along her shoulders, turning a final tiny wrench; the instant the last pin loosens, the collar’s weight tilts free and the air ripples outward. A cracked wall dial above the alley, its hands long held in an impossible pause, jerks forward with a soft stutter, and the frozen crowd in the compressed distance resumes a single breath at once. Loose clock-dust blooms into pale moths around her lifted chin, and her posture lengthens, as if strength itself has finally been returned to its rightful owner.
