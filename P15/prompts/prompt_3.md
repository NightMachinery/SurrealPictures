Vertical 2:3. In a cavernous rivergate hall lined with plush maroon passageways, a blue‑haired young woman in a bright raincoat is caught mid‑stride as she yanks a brass pull-cord hanging from the ceiling, unzipping the “weather” like a curtain; above her, a rectangular panel of night sky slides aside to reveal a different, unfamiliar constellation that pours down in a clean, wrong-colored light. At her ankle, a grinning pocket-sized companion in a tailored coat tips open a small ornate vessel, and glowing paper seals flutter out, snapping onto a giant departure board that instantly rewrites destinations into new names. The immediate consequence ripples through the room: maps printed on travelers’ tickets rearrange themselves, borderlines crawling like ink-worms, while a bone-white mask displayed in a glass case nearby turns to face her, its jawline cracking as if to speak. Outside the arched windows, a towering vine-lattice climbs into the newly revealed heavens, as if the building itself has decided to leave.
