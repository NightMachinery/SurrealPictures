Portrait 2:3 composition: On a moonlit roofline, a solitary traveler in a fitted midnight coat is caught mid-leap between two chimneys, reaching toward a faint “second star” that hangs unnaturally low; their open hand is ungloved, palm up, and a small paper house unfolds from it like an origami flower, its windows blinking awake. As the last crease snaps into place, a thumb-sized door appears in the brickwork beside them and swings inward by itself, spilling warm lamplight and the smell of tea into the cold air—yet no one is visible inside. The traveler’s expression is half-brave, half-bewitched, because a soft pressure dents their palm as if an unseen guest is taking the offered paper key. In the immediate consequence, the roof tiles beneath their boots begin to lift and flutter like old letters, revealing a distant horizon that has become a storm-swept prairie of charred totems struck by silent lightning, while childhood photographs drift upward like moths toward the open door.
