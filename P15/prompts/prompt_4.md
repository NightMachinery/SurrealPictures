Vertical 2:3 composition: in the center foreground, a weary young woman in a formal coat stitched at the throat with old silver “hush” pins is mid-swing, driving a three-pronged, spear-like tuning fork into a blue-white glacier that rises like a cathedral wall; her face is caught between relief and dread as the impact releases a visible chord—thin ribbons of light vibrating through the ice. At the exact moment the note blooms, a tall standing mirror beside her (its frame carved with family crests) begins to reflect not her body but the sound itself: the mirror-surface ripples into concentric rings, and hairline cracks race outward like lightning. The immediate consequence is unfolding now—tiny shards peel away from the glass and turn into pale moths that carry fragments of melody toward the sky, while the glacier answers with a slow, luminous fracture that resembles a smile. Snow hangs suspended, warm aurora-like glow mixes with cold moonlight, playful wonder edged with inherited fear.
