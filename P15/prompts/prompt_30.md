Vertical 2:3 — On a moonlit waterfront plaza, one solitary figure kneels before a waist-high brass console sunk into the cobblestones, its rounded buttons glowing like teeth as they hesitate mid-press; behind them, a semicircle of onlookers in mismatched festival masks lean in, silently judging, while a hovering hood of stitched cloth (embroidered with tiny barbs that snag the air) lowers toward the figure’s head and begins to project an unfamiliar insignia onto their chest as if announcing a role. The instant their finger commits and clicks a pale-blue button, the incoming surf surges over the seawall—then abruptly thickens, turning from water into clear, walkable steps that still ripple inside like trapped breath. Across the plaza, a monumental wooden parade animal that everyone assumed was only decorative splits along hidden seams, and warm lights spill out: dozens of drifting, candle-bright paper vessels float upward, circling the newly “solid” wave. The crowd’s masks tilt; the projected insignia flickers, and the figure rises with a tender, resilient smile that looks almost like grief, stepping into the glassy surge as it carries them forward.
