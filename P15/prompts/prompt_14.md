Vertical 2:3 — From the paving stones, the viewer looks up at a lone woman sprinting up the colossal steps of a nameless civic tower, her face strangely tranquil as she swings her arm to fling a single handful of pale petals into the air; the throw is caught mid-arc, with faint luminous streaks tracing where her body just was, as if time hesitated and then remembered to breathe. The petals don’t fall: they hover, turning into tiny unopened buds that rotate around her in a slow, deliberate ring, and wherever one brushes her skin it leaves a brief frost-kiss imprint that crystallizes her sleeve and then melts into ink, rewriting a subtle pattern on her wrist in real time. Behind her, solemn windows glow like watchful eyes, and a procession of empty coats hangs on invisible hooks, leaning toward the airborne buds as though awaiting a cue. The air is quiet, pollen-thick, and lightly threatening, lit by cold dawn filtered through high stone arches.
