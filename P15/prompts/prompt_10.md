Vertical 2:3 composition: from an extreme low angle, a lone dockside woman in wildflower-pattern linen and weathered denim leans back beneath colossal sea-salt columns that vanish into fog, her hair billowing as a dense, thunderous cloud-mane. Mid-stitch, she threads a needle through a torn, antique battle-standard draped over a stone bollard; each pull is gentle, almost intimate, as if mending a wound. A single enormous, wet-gloss eye floats at her shoulder like a patient witness, its gaze fixed on the moving thread. The immediate consequence blooms outward: the stitchline emits visible rings of echoing light that ripple across the water, making the suspended ships above the harbor—keels pointed to the sky as though gravity forgot—quiver and slowly begin to right themselves. Nearby, a half-spent candle-lighthouse gutters in the wind, and the lanterns caught in fishing nets flare brighter with every heartbeat of resonance, casting soft, unsettling warmth over the moment.
