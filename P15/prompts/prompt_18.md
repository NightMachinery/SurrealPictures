Vertical 2:3 composition: in the still-life foreground, a jeweled chalice lies on its side beside split figs, a cracked porcelain mask, and a ribbon of spilled honey that glows like a slow fuse. Beyond it, a striped, jewel-eyed jungle ape—draped in a deep crimson wrap—lifts a small tawny cub high with surprising gentleness, mid-motion as if offering it to the air itself. The cub’s paws stretch toward a tiny gilded sphere with delicate wings, which darts upward at the exact instant a circular absence opens behind them: a clean, silent “hole” in the room where the wallpaper becomes starless night. The immediate consequence is visible—plates and grapes on the banquet table begin sliding, then hovering, pulled toward the void; candle flames bend sideways; nearby guests remain present but oddly unalarmed, smiling as if asleep. Warm candlelight and cold lunar spill mingle, soft, whimsical, and faintly unsettling.
