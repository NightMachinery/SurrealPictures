Vertical 2:3 composition: An anxious parent in a raincoat, boots weighted by rusted iron anklets, strides mid-step onto a narrow copper footbridge suspended between stacked worlds—glassy ocean biomes below, a crowded forest canopy level with their chest, and far above a drifting ring of sealed vaults circling a dim black star. With one hand they clutch a damp passport; with the other they reach toward their own shadow, which has peeled off the deck and is sprinting ahead like a runaway child, dragging a glowing seed-pod that bursts into tiny moths of green life. The shadow’s theft tugs the bridge sideways; copper rivets groan, and the orbiting vault-ring begins to cant, spilling loose pages that fall like snow through every layer. At the parent’s shoulders, two serpent-shaped hoses—half living vine, half factory exhaust—coil tighter, hissing warnings. In the distance, two embrace-shaped statues lean toward a kiss beneath a skull-shaped lighthouse, as if romance itself is a forbidden navigation signal.
