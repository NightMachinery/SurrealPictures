A lone traveler, towering over a lacework city, leans into a sudden hush as if the world has hit a silent pause; with one hand they tug a thin, glowing filament from their own throat while the other presses a stolen nameplate against a tall mirrored vanity that refuses to show their face. Mid-pull, the filament unspools into ornate border patterns that crawl across the scene like embroidery, tightening into loops around drifting letters as they try to flee, and the traveler’s shoulders visibly rise with strain—then, in the same instant, a palpable lightness begins to lift from their back, as if an unseen pack is being unhooked. The environment is an isometric cutaway: the quarry floor is carved into rooms and streets at once, revealing interiors beneath pavements, all tiled with repeating motifs of apple blossoms and warning-red fruit; meteor-glass slabs jut from the earth, catching moonlit refractions while wind through the crystal sings without sound.
