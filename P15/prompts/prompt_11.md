Vertical 2:3 composition: On a canted seaside plain where the horizon leans like a tipped picture frame, a lone night watchwoman in a weathered coat lunges toward a waist-high brass console half-buried in salt sand, her gloved finger mid-press above a cluster of jewel-bright buttons. From the console’s cracked dials, a silent surge ripples outward: a river of shattered roof tiles, books, and broken chairs hangs suspended in midair, flowing sideways as if gravity has been briefly reassigned. At the same instant, her shoulders split into two living, ribbon-thick coils—neither snake nor scarf—curling protectively around her neck while their skin flashes between ember-glow and hoarfrost, shedding sparks that crystallize before falling. Above, paper lanterns drift upward, tugged by an unseen draft, their warm light stitching calm into the cold blue haze. The consequence is visible on her face: a sharp exhale, eyes widened in dawning relief, as the hovering debris begins to lighten and lift away from her shadow.
