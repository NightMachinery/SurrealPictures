Vertical 2:3 composition with subtle fisheye curvature at the edges: in the middle of a floating night market that arcs along a chain of pale moons, a soaked escapee is halfway out of an ornate glass aquarium—one knee on the rim, one hand gripping a gilded latch they’ve just sprung—while their other hand snatches a stolen name-plaque from a masked stallkeeper’s belt, the plaque still dripping ink as if freshly peeled from their own skin. The immediate consequence ripples outward: the aquarium water rises in a weightless wave that hardens into a wind, unfurling a tattered imperial-standard banner from its spray, and the banner’s shadow strikes a nearby tree already split by lightning, making its scar glow like a reopened wound. Above, vendors tug at seams in the heavens, swapping portions of sky like fabric panels; a too-bright dawn patch slides into place, and the escapee’s face shows fierce relief edging into unsettling, radiant joy as bystanders clap with expressions that don’t match their eyes.
