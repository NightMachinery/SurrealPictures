From an elevated balcony inside a perfectly symmetrical gallery of repeating archways, an androgynous caretaker leans forward mid-step, lifting a small gilded lantern as their free hand cracks open one of the identical doors; at that instant, a whole weatherfront pours through the doorway like a living curtain, curling around their ankles and flinging rain into the hall. Two sleek serpents rise from the caretaker’s shoulders, mouths close to their ears as if conducting the moment, and the caretaker’s face is caught between serene rapture and dawning dread. In the near foreground, hanging objects—keys, glass charms, and torn ribbons—swing across the view like a mobile, framing the action and echoing the corridor’s strict balance. A black cat in a narrow wire cage dangles from a hook beside the balcony rail, claws reaching out as the storm’s first lightning turns the nearest marble statue’s skin to fresh stone, one finger at a time.
