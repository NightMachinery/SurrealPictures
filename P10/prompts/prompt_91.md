Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded “frozen dream” interior that behaves like a cathedral built from bedrooms and ruins: at the exact center a glowing threshold shaped like a human-sized keyhole/doorway made from hundreds of braided friendship bracelets (their knots, beads, frayed ends and charms forming an ornate arch), and instead of a door it is draped with a living golden fleece that billows like sunlit hair and also like a storm cloud—its curls emitting blinding, euphoric radiance that becomes the scene’s only “gravity.” Two mythic phoenix presences dominate the midground: not generic birds, but tall, semi-human figures with classical, vulnerable bodies—skin kissed by ash-gold, shoulders and hips feathering into ember-plumage, wings half-unfurled like ceremonial capes; one phoenix leans forward as if stepping through the bracelet-arch, the other holds them back by the wrist with a gesture that can read as lover’s restraint, rescuing grip, or possessive claim; their faces are close but unreadable (eyes like warm mirrors, mouths parted mid-breath), and their bodies shed feathers that freeze in midair as bright petals, tiny burning letters, and moths. Dream logic breaks physics loudly: the floor becomes a vertical wall near the threshold, stair treads spiral outward into the air like ribs, liquid light pours upward into goblets, and scattered objects orbit the bracelet-knot core in a radial explosion—rings, torn tickets, keys, rosary-like beads, fragments of masks, a small cracked mirror reflecting a different season, a champagne flute suspended with a bubble halfway born, a crown of burnt laurels, a single high-heeled shoe filled with seawater, a feathered heartbeat drawn as a thin red thread. Foreground is dense with tactile clues: pooled gold fibers from the fleece like spilled honey-wool, handprints in ash, a bracelet clasp snapped open beside a locket containing nothing, wet footprints that lead to the doorway then reverse direction, a discarded bouquet that is also a nest, scattered photographs whose subjects are scratched out, and a curled ribbon that resembles a tongue or a river. Background multiplies the threshold theme without resolving it: nested doorways inside doorways recede impossibly, some opening into daylight, some into night, some into a childhood hallway, some into a blank white stage; curtains become wings, window frames become picture frames, and distant silhouettes applaud silently from behind glass that is also water. Lighting is ecstatic and overwhelming—white-gold bloom from the fleece-core with prismatic halos and sharp, celebratory highlights—yet the euphoria is paradoxically intimate: every corner contains a secret tenderness or quiet dread, every object feels like evidence, and the entire composition is radial and explosive from the bracelet-and-fleece center, packed with occlusions, layered depth, and suspended motion, asking a question it refuses to answer.
