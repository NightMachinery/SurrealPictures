Vertical 2:3 frame designed like a crowded surreal collage: a still-life foreground stacked in sharp planes against a dramatic storm-prairie background, with thin mosaic borders and inset “poster panels” that contradict the main space (small vignettes repeating the same objects at different scales, like memory fragments). In the foreground, a dense altar-table of metamorphosis: a cracked metronome leaking light instead of sand; a half-assembled string instrument fused with clockwork ribs and drafting tools; patent diagrams printed on translucent skin; glass jars trapping lightning in coiled filaments; orchids sprouting from brass screws; a tuning fork shaped like an ankh, heavy and tactile, casting a shadow that looks like a doorway. Everywhere the physics is broken by **fluid solidity**: rain hangs as bead-curtains you could push aside; puddles stand upright like vertical mirrors; a river runs as a rigid, glassy ribbon folded into steps; smoke pours like wet cement and freezes mid-splash; spilled ink becomes a sculpted staircase; sound waves from the instrument congeal into lacquered blocks that support objects like pedestals. Midground anchor: two mythic figures close enough to share breath—**the Musician** and **the Inventor**—not generic, but solemn and radiant, caught in an intimate social exchange (half-embrace / half-negotiation): the Musician’s posture arched as if pulled by a melody that has weight, fingers pressing strings that appear to be tendons; the Inventor leaning in, one hand steadying the instrument, the other holding a blueprint that is actively transforming into feathers and circuitry. Their bodies are in active metamorphosis without resolving into a single meaning: skin turning to varnished wood grain then back to skin; collarbones becoming delicate gear teeth; hair unraveling into copper wire and then into grass; a shared shadow that cannot belong to either of them alone. Between them, suspended at chest height, a small **Simurgh** is physically present yet ambiguous—part storm-bird, part origami, part constellation—its wings made of layered paper, feathers, and metal shavings, as if invented and summoned at once; it sheds luminous plumage that becomes notes, seeds, and tiny machine parts as it falls. Background: a storm prairie jammed with **lightning-struck totems** (bone poles, rusted antennae, carved stones, stitched leather standards, broken statues) so dense there is no empty horizon; each strike leaves branching scars that resemble veins, roots, and musical staves. The prairie itself participates in transformation—grass blades becoming fine glass needles, then soft fabric, then living hair—while distant totems bear ankhs carved, welded, and grown into them in different eras. Lighting and color must read as **blinding joy** despite the storm: prismatic, ecstatic glare like a sunrise inside thunderclouds; halos, lens-like flares, glittering pollen/confetti of sparks; wet highlights that feel celebratory rather than grim. Fill every corner with readable micro-details that refuse a single narrative: masks half-buried in upright puddle-doors, a wedding ring threaded on a screw, a tiny funeral wreath made of wire, a child’s toy drifting in frozen smoke, a kiss-mark on a schematic, fingerprints in varnish, keys that sprout wings, and torn labels with illegible handwriting—everything suggesting many stories at once, frozen mid-impossible event.
