Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded interior of an impossible library-cathedral at twilight: vaulted aisles of leaning shelves curve like a ribcage around a central “seat” that is unmistakably occupied by an **invisible presence**—a deep-body indentation in a velvet chair, drifting heat-haze outlining absent shoulders, dust and loose pages orbiting a hollow human silhouette, and a chain of lantern light bending around someone who is not there; two mythic librarians stand close at the threshold of this void, socially entangled rather than posed—one tall and androgynous with ink-stained hands and a heavy keyring of bone bookmarks, the other older with a shaved head and a soft, worn robe sliding open to reveal vulnerable classical nudity at the ribs and collarbone (tender, not pornographic), their foreheads nearly touching as they exchange a single open book like a fragile offering, gratitude palpable in their softened gaze and in their hands that almost clasp but don’t; the **Pied Piper’s flute** is physically present and essential: an ornate flute of tarnished silver and wood rests between them like a third participant—half held, half suspended by the invisible guest—its finger-holes pressing dimples into empty air, while visible **resonance/echo** ripples radiate from it as concentric rings that turn into repeating motifs across the scene (duplicated shadows that lag behind bodies, mirrored titles on book spines, multiple faint afterimages of the librarians’ hands at different distances, sound-waves that become staircases and then become lines of text); the atmosphere is **overflowing thanks** rendered as warm honey-gold lantern light spilling everywhere—hundreds of lantern-festival paper lanterns drift through the stacks like slow hearts or lungs, some snagged on ladders, some nested inside open books, some reflected in tears on a cheek, each lantern carrying tiny handwritten thank-you notes in many languages like prayer slips, with confetti-like scraps of vellum and dried flowers floating in still air; foreground: toppled cart, spilled ink forming a black river that forks into calligraphic “thank you” shapes, a gloved hand offering a lantern to nobody, a pile of returned books bound with red thread like gifts; midground: masked readers frozen mid-bow, a ladder held steady by an unseen weight, a row of candles lit with no flame source, footprints appearing in dust without feet; background: an arched doorway opens onto a night sky thick with more lanterns rising like a festival—yet the “outside” is also another aisle of the same library, looping back on itself; corners packed with small paradoxes (a page being erased while it’s written, a bell jar containing a miniature lantern festival, a cracked mirror showing the invisible presence as a faint outline while reflecting the librarians as empty), no empty space, every surface layered with clues that suggest tenderness, shame, longing, grief, and ecstasy without resolving into a single narrative.
