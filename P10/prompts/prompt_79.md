A vertical 2:3 frame inside an ink-black chapel of mirrored confessionals, every surface glossy as wet obsidian, crowded with reflections that disagree with each other; in the midground two children (timeless, solemn, gender-ambiguous) stand close as if sharing one secret breath—one in an oversized mourning coat stitched with seed-pearls and tiny brass fasteners, the other in a simple robe patched like an heirloom, both haloed not by light but by drifting pollen-like motes and suspended dust; between their hands they cradle a large glass hourglass whose “sand” is a swarm of luminous seeds frozen mid-fall, each seed sprouting miniature clockwork roots and petals that click open like gears, the glass subtly shaped like a ribcage, warm light pulsing from within as if it has a heartbeat; from the hourglass spills a Jacob’s ladder that is physically present and impossible—rungs of mirrored bone and rosary beads, side-rails braided from braided copper vines—unfurling upward and downward at once, vanishing into a confessional mirror and reappearing from another at a wrong angle, as if the chapel is folding space; the confessionals are personified: carved doors with soft, ambiguous faces in the woodgrain, keyholes like eyes, curtains like tongues of velvet, some “listening,” some “blushing” with internal gold; mechanical nature dominates—black ivy made of articulated brass joints, flowers of enamel and watch-springs blooming from kneelers, moths with filigree wings and tiny numbered dials hovering in clusters, a choir of candlesticks bent like spines, all frozen in the instant of bursting into growth; the atmosphere is transcendent bliss and healing warmth despite the darkness: honeyed light beams leak through hairline cracks and reflect into infinity, wrapping the children in compassionate glow while the rest of the chapel remains ink-deep, creating a paradox of comfort inside dread; enforce heavy foreground occlusion: close-up veils of translucent fabric and bead chains cross the frame, thorny vines and wrought-iron railings cut diagonals, droplets of mirrored “sap” hang in midair, partially blocking the protagonists and forcing layered depth; corners packed with ambiguous relics—scattered keys, cracked masks, tiny mechanical hearts, half-open prayer books with blank pages, petals mixed with screws—everything sharply detailed, no empty horizons, no readable story, only a frozen dream-riddle where every reflection suggests a different memory.
