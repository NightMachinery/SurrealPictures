Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded from edge to edge: on a monolithic basalt coast of towering black columns packed like organ pipes, under a perpetual aurora that hangs motionless like a frozen curtain of green-violet light, the sea is caught mid-surge—waves suspended in glassy arcs, spray beads and salt crystals hovering in perfect stillness. Center foreground on a low basalt dais carved with concentric grooves (a ritual circle worn by countless bare feet), an ageless Oracle sits half-draped in layered ceremonial cloth and partially nude like a classical statue warmed by breath; their posture is serene, heavy with authority, eyes open but unfocused as if listening inward. Kneeling close, a Parent—tired, tender, powerful—presses their forehead to the Oracle’s sternum while cradling a child who is simultaneously an infant and an adult (same face at different ages), the three bodies forming a closed loop of touch: the child’s hand rests on the Parent’s throat, the Parent’s hand covers the Oracle’s heart, the Oracle’s hand cups the child’s skull—an intimate cycle that reads as blessing, apology, seduction, and farewell depending on the viewer. Between Oracle and Parent burns the Eternal Flame of Atar in a shallow basalt brazier fused into the rock; the fire does not flicker, it is a steady, silent, impossibly bright core, and its light reveals fine ash and tiny gold flecks suspended in the air like insects in amber. From the brazier’s rim sprouts a beanstalk as thick as a limb, climbing immediately upward and outward, threading through the scene: it braids around basalt columns, stitches through carved archways, pierces tidepools, and disappears into the aurora, its leaves shaped like small hands and ears, its pods like sealed envelopes. The broken physics is blatant: memory projections pour out of the figures and the coast as luminous, semi-transparent “rooms” and “moments” that occupy physical space—miniature staircases, hospital curtains, a dinner table, a lover’s silhouette, a child’s bedroom wallpaper, a courtroom bench, a wedding veil, a funeral wreath—each drifting like soap-bubble architecture yet casting real shadows on the basalt; some memories are projected onto skin like moving frescoes, sliding across ribs, thighs, and cheeks; others bloom from the beanstalk leaves like lanterns, or run in looping bands around the monoliths like a slow, silent film reel. The ritual/cycle motif repeats everywhere: braided hair forms circles, prayer beads coil into spirals, tidal rings in the sand echo the carved grooves, and small figures in the midground—hooded attendants, faceless dancers, elderly twins, a nude athlete, a veiled bride, a child holding a mask—stand perfectly still in a procession that loops back on itself, stepping onto footprints that are already there; none look directly at the viewer, yet all seem aware. Pack the corners with decipherable-but-uncertain objects: cracked icons, seashells filled with tiny flames, wet feathers, keys, teeth, broken toys, dried flowers, folded letters, a split hourglass leaking not sand but faint light, and basalt shards engraved with the same symbol repeated in different handwriting styles. The overall mood is contentment as perfect stillness—no panic, no struggle—only a calm, intimate inevitability as the coast seems to both birth and consume the trio, while the aurora and the suspended sea hold the entire paradox in a single, paused breath.
