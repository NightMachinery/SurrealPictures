Vertical 2:3 frame, a submarine cathedral wedged in a bioluminescent trench: ribbed hull-arches and riveted buttresses form a nave packed with drifting debris—drowned hymnals, rusted compasses, rosary-like bubble chains, pearl dust, torn love letters sealed in wax, small fish frozen mid-turn like punctuation marks; the architecture is crowded with mosaics of hands, lungs, keys, and maps, and ornamental border patterns (passport stamps, lace filigree, nautical charts, saintly halos, warning stripes) creep inward from the card edges and physically invade the scene, becoming vines, frames, and bands that slice space into stacked planes like a constructed collage. At the center, a mythic Giant—colossal, androgynous, tenderly exposed as if carved from living pearl and bruised marble—kneels with the gravity of an altar, while a smaller Guardian in ceremonial diver-priest regalia (helmet like a reliquary, mantle of stitched flags and kelp, hands bare) stands close enough to be intimate; they touch foreheads and share a single breath bubble between them, and where their hands meet they are mid-fusion: fingers interlaced into one impossible hand that becomes a braided conduit of veins/cables, feeding into the cathedral walls as if the building is being born from their union. Above them hovers a broken crown, cracked into orbiting shards that are suspended mid-fall like a halo in pieces—each fragment reflecting a different face, a different age, a different verdict—while a spinning wheel of fate (part ship’s wheel, part loom, part turbine) is caught in the instant of motion: spokes blurred only by implication, thread/copper wire streaming out yet frozen, stitching together wounds in the air and binding the Giant to the Guardian and both to the cathedral’s ribs. In the far apse stands the Gate of All Nations, an impossibly ornate portal made from welded borders—arches of coins, visas, beads, feathers, and sea-glass—covered in many alphabets and emblems that feel recognizable but remain unreadable; it is open, and what should be dark trench-water beyond it shows the defining impossibility: the “sky” has been replaced by a vast, sunlit terrestrial firmament of drifting clouds and distant birds, as if daylight has been pasted into the ocean’s ceiling—shafts of warm light pour downward like liquid, mixing with cold bioluminescent greens and deep blues, so tenderness and cosmic awe coexist in the same breath. Fill every corner with quiet clues and contradictions: miniature altars inside portholes, saints with diver masks, a child’s crown made of seaweed, a whale-eye reflected in a chalice, broken shackles shaped like wedding rings, and tiles depicting doors opening into water opening into sky; keep the entire scene perfectly still, as if time stopped at the exact moment love and authority, protection and surrender, are becoming indistinguishable.
