Worm’s-eye view from the marble floor of a mirror-maze embassy wedged between two rival kingdoms: the bottom of the frame is dominated by a towering foreground ornament—an immense carved threshold/canopy pole wrapped in braided ribbons, prayer-knots, wax seals, and hair, so close it feels like it could fall onto the viewer; beyond it, the space is flattened into stacked decorative planes like a designed collage—layered mosaic borders, inset “panel” reflections, overlapping curtains, stamps, medallions, and mirror facets that refuse natural depth. At the center, under a suspended wedding canopy (held up by silent attendants whose bodies are partly reflected, partly missing), the Dreamer and the Weaver are locked in a sacred, ambiguous interaction: the Dreamer (mythic, timeless, androgynous; bare skin with ritual paint and faint bruised-gold light like dawn under the flesh) hovers half-kneeling as if rising from sleep, eyes closed, mouth slightly open in reverence or surrender; the Weaver (tall, severe, tender; draped in diplomat-vestments that also resemble funeral cloth) threads luminous filaments pulled from the Dreamer’s sternum and fingertips—threads that become the scene’s genesis: they braid into a Tree of Life whose trunk is made of interlaced tongues, cords, umbilical ribbons, and diplomatic scrolls, roots spreading across mirror tiles and into the viewer’s foreground; its fruit are tiny doors, eggs, and keys, each reflecting a different childhood memory or adult regret without stating which. Behind them looms the Gate of All Nations: an impossible arch assembled from passports, coins, masks, broken vows, and many alphabets that never form legible words; the gate is also a portal-displacement wound—through it, whole rooms from elsewhere intrude at wrong angles (a shoreline ceiling, a bedroom corridor, a cathedral stair) jutting into the embassy like misfiled memories, their horizons rotated, their light spilling sideways into the mirrors. Emotional weather is the defining physics: localized storms hover inside the embassy with droplets and debris frozen midair—rain that looks like tears but falls upward, thunderclouds shaped like clenched hands, a warm front like a translucent veil pressed to skin, a snowfall of ring-shaped blossoms, lightning that branches into family-tree diagrams; each mirror facet catches a different weather system, so the same figures appear grieving in one reflection, ecstatic in another, ashamed in another. The rival kingdoms’ envoys crowd the edges and corners—masked, armed, perfumed, half-nude under ceremonial armor—watching in sacred silence; their postures read as witnesses, jurors, lovers, executioners, or parents depending on the viewer. Fill every corner with symbolic clutter and suspended motion: floating glass shards reflecting womb-like chambers, scattered pearls like teeth, tiny stitched banners, incense smoke held like lace, spilled wine beading into constellations, feathers, petals, and ash orbiting the canopy; everything paused at the exact instant creation happens and nobody knows if it is a blessing, a treaty, a marriage, or a birth. Soft reverent lighting (candle-gold and deep blue) with radiant halos trapped in mirror seams; no empty space, no clear narrative, no legible text; aspect ratio 2:3.
