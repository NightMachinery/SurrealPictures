Vertical 2:3 frame, packed edge-to-edge: a cinder valley of black ash and smoking, iridescent glass dunes like melted bottles reshaped into waves; the air is crowded with suspended soot, glittering shards, drifting feathers, tiny medals, torn prayer slips, and half-burned letters, all frozen mid-tumble as if time stopped at the peak of a gust. In the foreground, a thorny burning bush erupts from a split in the ash—its fire is luminous and delicate (blue-gold, not consuming the branches), casting intricate, lace-like shadows across the glass sand; within those shadows, faint shapes suggest hands, wings, and kneeling bodies without ever resolving. Center stage: two adult twins (mythic, nearly identical yet emotionally opposed)—tall, androgynous, one wrapped in pale ash-stained bandages like a fallen angel’s training tape, the other mostly nude except for thin jewelry of cracked glass and faint bruises like old constellations; they stand close enough to be mistaken for a single figure until you notice the doubled hands and mismatched expressions. Between them is an adult athlete, powerful but exhausted, kneeling in cinders with one shin pressed into hot glass, skin dusted with ash as if wearing a second, fragile body; a shattered laurel of translucent glass rests on the athlete’s head like a crown that could also be a wound. The twins hold the athlete in a paradoxical embrace: one twin steadies the athlete’s jaw with tenderness, the other presses two fingers to the athlete’s sternum as if granting permission to breathe; their touch transforms the immediate ground—cinders lift into slow, gentle spirals and the glass dunes near their feet soften into liquid-looking ripples, hinting at forgiveness/grace as a physical law rather than a moral lesson. A red cloak is present as a dominant, living object: it loops around all three bodies like a single ribbon caught mid-flutter, simultaneously shielding and exposing—part veil, part banner, part accusation—its hem trailing into the burning bush’s light and then vanishing beneath the ash as if it continues underground. In their joined hands they share one small cup (simple, ancient, ambiguous in material—clay or bone or hammered silver), held at chest height so all three fingertips touch it; its surface reflects a different world than the valley, and a single bead of liquid hovers above the rim, unmoving, like a held breath. The defining impossibility: there is no sky—over the dunes hangs a colossal inverted chalice the size of the heavens, forming the entire firmament; inside it swirls a milky ocean of light where fish-like shapes, toys, broken trophies, and tiny doorways drift like constellations, and from its rim fall countless luminous droplets that freeze mid-descent, each droplet containing a minuscule scene (a hand forgiving a hand, a face turning away, a mouth about to confess, a childlike wonder of discovery) that can’t be read clearly. The lighting is prismatic, dawn-warm, and curious—wonder rather than terror—yet the faces and poses remain unreadable: shame could be devotion, ecstasy could be grief, mercy could be surrender; fill the corners with half-buried mirrors that reflect different postures of the trio, distant basalt arches that resemble stadium gates and cathedral ribs at once, and faint track lines in the ash that lead nowhere. No text, no overt violence, no explicit sex—only charged, vulnerable bodies, dense symbolic clutter, and a frozen moment that feels intimately familiar but cannot be explained.
