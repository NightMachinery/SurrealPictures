Vertical 2:3 frame, a vast interior that cannot decide whether it is a temple, a greenhouse, or a half-built city: stone arches grow bark and leaf-veins, columns are braided tree trunks wrapped in carved staircases, windows are honeycomb of stained glass and living membranes; roots thread through tiled floors like inlaid bronze, and the ceiling is an upside-down orchard whose branches turn into flying buttresses, bearing silent nests of miniature doorways. Center foreground: a mythic Architect (age-ambiguous, severe and tender at once) stands barefoot on a circular clock-face set into the floor like a plaza—its hands missing, its numerals cracked, stopped forever at an unreadable hour—wearing a long mantle made of folded maps, drafting vellum, and stitched measuring tapes; in one hand a compass and in the other a blunt chisel that looks like a pen. Facing them, close enough for breath to touch, the Avatar (androgynous, classically proportioned, mostly nude except for a translucent veil that clings like mist) holds their own posture with calm, consenting stillness; their skin carries faint architectural lines like old scars—floorplans, doorframes, stair-spirals—yet these markings also resemble constellations. From the Avatar’s shoulders rise the shoulder-serpents of Zahhak as living epaulettes: two pale, regal snakes that curve upward and then rest their heads near the collarbones, eyes half-closed in contentment, tongues frozen mid-taste; their bodies blend seamlessly into the surrounding cornices as if the building itself is their spine. The Architect presses the compass point gently to the Avatar’s sternum—no blood, only a small opening like a hinged oculus—and inside is a luminous “eureka” core: a seed of pure geometry that blooms into a tiny impossible model-city/heart, radiating hairline cracks of light that travel outward into the room; wherever the light reaches, masonry quietly turns into living wood, leaf, coral, or bone, and vines harden into balustrades, making the architecture/nature fusion the obvious broken law of physics. Between their joined hands, suspended as if time has been pinned, floats a poisoned apple: beautiful, too ripe, beaded with ink-dark dew that never falls; a single bite-mark reveals not flesh but mirrored chambers, and a thin black ribbon of venom hangs in the air like a calligraphic stroke, threading toward the stopped clock below without touching it. Crowd every layer: foreground littered with fallen keys, cracked masks, eraser shavings like snow, and small blueprint scraps that fold themselves into moths mid-flight; midground filled with alcoves holding sleeping statues with open eyes, ladders that climb into pools of still water, and shelves of bottled sunsets labeled in unknown handwriting; background packed with a distant cityscape that is also a forest canopy, bridges made of ribcages, balconies sprouting flowers shaped like door handles, and a far horizon visible through an arch that is actually the inside of a hollow tree. In the corners, tiny human silhouettes (or mannequins) sit at banquet tables set for nobody, faces turned away, each holding a different version of the apple; above them, dust, petals, droplets, and hair-thin shards of mirror hang motionless, catching soft honeyed light and cool shadow in perfect equilibrium. The entire scene is perfectly still and strangely comforting—no wind, no panic—yet every object suggests a confession, a discovery, a surrender, and a secret that might be desire or grief depending on who is looking.
