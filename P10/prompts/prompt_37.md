Vertical 2:3 frame, a collapsed opera house frozen mid-catastrophe: cracked velvet balconies tilt like stacked paper theaters, chandeliers hang mid-fall with their crystal drops suspended like pearls, torn opera posters and sheet-music pages hover in the air like slow confetti; everything is being quietly overgrown by phosphorescent ivy that glows turquoise-green and threads through seats, ribs of broken architecture, and the torn curtain, turning ruin into a playful, living puzzle. In the foreground on the fractured stage, three widows form an intimate triangle—timeless, heavy with ritual and contradiction—draped in mourning fabrics that read as both funeral veils and bridal trains; their bodies are classical and vulnerable (sensual but not explicit), yet every face is impossible: one is a smooth, blank oval of porcelain, one is only a dark veil with no features behind it, one is a shallow concave mirror reflecting the opera house but never a person. Their posture is social and tense-tender: one widow leans forward with childlike curiosity, palms open as if asking to be shown; another steadies her by the wrist as if warning her; the third stands slightly apart, shoulders squared, grief held like armor, yet her open hand is extended toward the others in a gesture that could be blessing, invitation, refusal, or surrender. The defining physics-break: “fluid solidity” runs through the entire scene—marble columns drip like wax into puddles that harden into steps mid-spill; shattered glass flows upward like a ribbon and becomes rigid again as it frames the widows; the collapsed proscenium arch pours like thick paint yet holds its shape; the stage floor is a shallow pool of liquid stone with ripples frozen, reflecting a starry ceiling that no longer exists. Zahhak’s shoulder serpents are present as living totems: from the widows’ shoulders emerge two serpents each, but ambiguously formed from ivy, silk, and lacquered bone—curious rather than purely monstrous—coiling around their necklines like jewelry, tasting the air with tongues made of tiny musical notes; one serpent’s mouth offers a ring, another steals a tear, another nuzzles an open palm as if seeking comfort. The open-hand motif repeats obsessively as architecture and omen: a gigantic sculpted hand rises from the liquid stone at center stage, palm up like a pedestal; smaller hands appear as carved armrests, glove-forms, shadow-hands cast by no body, handprints in dust on broken mirrors—some beckoning, some accusing, some pleading. The atmosphere is whimsical and absurd despite the ache: footlights still glow warm amber from beneath the rubble, illuminating ivy like bioluminescent lace; paper masks with no faces drift like moths; a toppled harp sprouts vines; a flock of tiny origami swans made from program pages circles a suspended candelabra. Collage logic flattens space and crowds every corner: ornate decorative border motifs (filigree of hands, serpents, ivy, lace, and cracked gilding) invade the scene interior as physical frames-within-frames, mosaic panels, and poster-like stacked planes—some borders tear open into real depth, others behave like stickers on reality—so the image reads like a designed shrine that’s simultaneously stage set, reliquary, and dream. Fill foreground/midground/background with clues that don’t resolve: scattered wedding flowers browned to ash beside fresh ivy blossoms, a single black glove pinned by a hairpin, pearls floating like bubbles, a locket open to an empty portrait, a ladder that leads nowhere, balcony seats facing the wrong direction; the entire tableau locked in one silent, high-detail instant that asks a question it refuses to name.
