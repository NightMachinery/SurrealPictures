Vertical 2:3 frame, three-quarter cinematic viewpoint standing on a ledge inside a meteor-glass quarry: terraced walls of fractured, translucent stone and fused meteorite veins form an almost perfect bilateral symmetry, like a cathedral carved by impact. The air is crowded with “singing winds” made visible—ribbons of dust, fine glass filaments, and drifting sheet-music fragments that bend into treble clefs, knots, and playful spirals as if the quarry itself is humming. In the center, two mythic figures face each other across an invisible axis of balance: a Matchmaker (ageless, androgynous, calm authority) holding a spool of luminous thread and a small pair of ceremonial shears; opposite, a Musician (tender, exhausted glamour) cradling an instrument whose strings are the Matchmaker’s thread. Their posture mirrors, but not perfectly—one leans in, one leans away—creating tense symmetry like a human scale about to tip. The impossible “Frozen Dream” event is overt: duplication and portal displacement everywhere—multiple copies of each figure appear simultaneously inside prismatic portals embedded in the quarry walls and suspended meteor shards; an arm reaches out of one portal while the rest of the body stands elsewhere; the instrument’s neck exits a shard in the foreground while its body rests in the Musician’s lap; the Matchmaker’s thread passes through several portals, tying distant duplicates into one continuous line that loops back on itself. A victory wreath of laurel (woven from iridescent meteor glass and soft, living leaves) floats between them, perfectly centered yet slightly misaligned in reflection, casting split shadows that disagree with each other. Above and behind, a vast Simurgh is physically present as both creature and architecture: half perched, half inlaid—its wings span the quarry like a stained-glass scaffolding of feathers, each feather a different shard that contains tiny displaced scenes (weddings, funerals, concerts, empty beds, hands letting go) too small to read clearly. Crowd every corner: foreground strewn with cracked mirrors, compass-and-scale instruments made of glass, rings, masks, spilled salt, small cherub-like quarry workers made of paper and wire tugging at the thread-strings, moths with transparent wings, floating droplets that refract miniature duplicates; midground ladders, pulleys, and suspended meteor blocks that act as portals; background terraces filled with carved niches of faces and hands that may be statues or trapped echoes. Lighting is whimsical and prismatic—soft carnival glow and sunbeams splitting into pastel spectrums—yet the expressions and touch remain ambiguous (tenderness vs manipulation, longing vs relief), as if the moment is balanced on the edge of a decision that never resolves. Deep parallax and deep focus: sharp detail from nearest glass splinters to the farthest terraces, no empty sky, the quarry and the song-wind consuming and birthing the scene at once.
