Vertical 2:3 frame inside an overgrown greenhouse parlor: Victorian settee, toppled side tables, shattered mirrors, and a small stone wishing well embedded in an ornate rug, all being slowly swallowed by bioluminescent vines that crawl over glass panes and furniture like luminous veins; the entire scene is caught in a profound pause—candle smoke hangs in rigid ribbons, a spill of wine is frozen mid-splash, dust motes and torn petals hover without falling, and even the rain outside the greenhouse windows is suspended as beads that never slide. Centered in the midground, “the Beast” kneels with mythic weight—tall, broad, partly human, partly something older, its skin marked like worn marble; from each shoulder grows a living serpent (Zahhak), their bodies coiled forward as if to whisper into the air, their mouths near (but not quite touching) the other figure. Opposite and slightly elevated, “the Vessel” is an androgynous nude figure with classical vulnerability, skin like porcelain warmed by lamplight; their posture is both surrender and command, one hand braced on the wishing well’s lip, the other pressed to the Beast’s chest as if stopping a heartbeat. The well is impossibly deep yet present, and its “water” breaks physics: a solid river of liquidity rises from it in a slow spiral, like a wave sculpted from glassy stone, flowing upward through the room while remaining rigid—coins, rings, and tiny personal relics are embedded inside this solid-flowing column as if caught in time; where it touches furniture, the wood appears to “melt” into smooth stone folds that still read as flowing fabric. A death’s-head moth is physically present and unmistakable, frozen mid-flight near their faces (wings open, casting a skull-shaped shadow across the Vessel’s throat), while smaller moths and shed scales pepper the foreground like ash. Crowd every corner: foreground cluttered with cracked teacups filled with solidified water, wilting orchids threaded through broken jewelry, a tipped music box with silent teeth, and a hand mirror reflecting a different angle of the serpents; background dense with greenhouse latticework, hanging planters, drifting curtains turned to stiff “liquid stone,” and glowing vines looping like constellations around the window frames. Lighting and color carry beautiful grief: cold moonlight filtered through wet glass meets bruised amber lamplight, making skin luminous yet fragile, greens and teals pulsing softly from the vines; no readable text, no clean horizon, no empty space—only layered objects and contradictions suggesting tenderness, dread, desire, and mourning at once.
