A tall, travel-worn explorer and an intimate, timeless romantist stand in the center of an overstuffed grandmother’s salon, locked in a paradoxical embrace that reads equally as reunion, farewell, rescue, and capture: the explorer’s coat hangs half-off one shoulder like a shed skin, revealing a vulnerable torso marked with faint map-lines; the romantist is draped in heavy lace curtains and quilt fragments that cling like a home trying not to let go, one hand inside the explorer’s open collar as if searching for a heartbeat, the other offering a small house-shaped locket that is also a compass. From each of the explorer’s shoulders, two living serpents emerge like epaulettes—Zahhak’s shoulder serpents rendered as elegant, unsettling companions (glossy scales, humanlike eyes), their bodies weaving through hair, jewelry, and upholstery; they are not attacking, but listening, tasting the air, and gently guiding the explorer’s posture as if steering a conscience. The salon itself behaves like “shelter”: armchairs curl into ribcage forms, wallpaper blossoms into protective hands, crocheted doilies become halos and nets, and every surface is crowded with domestic relics (stacked framed photos with faces scratched away, keys on ribbons, cracked porcelain dolls, half-unpacked suitcases, prayer beads tangled with pearl necklaces, love letters pinned like butterflies, a child’s nightlight shaped like a lighthouse, a teacup ocean with a tiny door floating on it). An hourglass dominates the architecture—part chandelier, part window, part altar—frozen mid-spill: instead of sand, it pours miniature rooms, staircases, and warm-lit windows that tumble upward and sideways, forming a hovering “house” around the couple; some tiny rooms contain impossible echoes of them (a bed without a mattress, a table set for two with no plates, a cradle holding a compass). The crucial broken logic is overt synesthesia: the mechanical songbirds—dozens of jeweled clockwork birds perched on curtain rods, inside gilt cages, and nested in the chandelier—sing in metallic clicks that become visible as embroidered ribbons and stained-glass sound-waves curling through the air; those sound-ribbons cast soft colored shadows that feel tactile, like velvet you can touch with your eyes, while the scent of tea and old perfume appears as translucent geometric petals drifting like confetti; the light itself seems audible, pooling in the corners as silent bells. Space is flattened into stacked planes and ornate borders: a patchwork of patterned wallpaper, rug mosaics, lace overlays, and framed vignettes that crowd every corner with clues; mirrors behave like cut-out panels showing alternate angles (the couple older/younger, clothed/unclothed, holding hands or holding an hourglass), without resolving which is “real.” Freeze the moment at peak impossibility—everything suspended mid-fall, mid-song, mid-breath—yet emotionally lit with childlike wonder: warm honeyed glow from a curtained window, prismatic highlights on brass and glass, dust motes like tiny planets, no empty space anywhere; foreground clutter (spilled buttons, map fragments, broken clock gears, feathers of metal), midground intimacy (skin, lace, serpents, hourglass), background density (cages, portraits, cabinets, borders within borders).
