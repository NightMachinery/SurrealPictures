Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded “frozen dream” paused mid-event: in an orchid swamp under pearl-dawn mist, bone-white walkways like polished vertebrae weave and knot above still black water, crowded with orchids that resemble velvet mouths, translucent frogs like glass paperweights, and drifting scraps of lace, gears, and index cards hovering as if buoyed by breath. Center foreground: the Clockmaker and the Librarian face each other close enough to share air—mythic, intimate, and unhurried—caught in the exact instant of a playful exchange: the Clockmaker (salt-and-silver hair pinned with tiny escapements, rolled sleeves, vest half-unbuttoned revealing skin etched with faint dial marks like old scars) steadies a pocket-watch the size of a dinner plate in both hands; the Librarian (tall, calm, ink-stained fingers, wet garment made of layered catalog cards and sheer fabric clinging like pages after rain, collarbone adorned with a bookmark like a pendant) offers an open book whose spine bends like a wrist. Their eyes don’t accuse or plead; they share a private, serene mischief, as if about to begin a game neither can explain. The impossible law of the scene is loud and undeniable: objects are people and people are partly objects—candlesticks at the feast table have shoulders and tired, beautiful faces; goblets lean together whispering; a chess rook yawns; a metronome breathes; books sprout hands that turn their own pages; clocks have bare feet and dance on the walkway with motion implied but perfectly still, each second-sweep frozen mid-arc like a blade of light. Midground: a long feast table is physically present yet paradoxical—half banquet, half reclining body—its “tablecloth” a sheet of pale skin patterned with fine hair-thin clock springs; plates are moons; cutlery resembles surgical instruments softened into toys; fruit is made of polished wood and bruised velvet; laughter is suggested by spilled wine suspended as ruby beads in midair. Rising behind it, the Tower of Babel appears as a spiraling stack of shelves, dinnerware, and multilingual manuscripts becoming architecture—bricks of dictionaries, mortar of wax seals, ladders made of rib bones—crowded with tiny human-like objects (inkwells with legs, letter-openers with masks, a teapot nursing steam like a child) all facing different directions as if misunderstanding is a form of play. Above the protagonists, woven into hanging vines and suspended dust, the Faravahar is unmistakably present: a hovering winged disc built from layered pages and clock hands, its feathers made of bookmarks, its ring a perfect ouroboros of braided library cards; it casts a calm, tender light like moon through milk, anchoring the serenity. Background corners are busy: submerged statues of cherubs made from drawer handles; a school of fish shaped like tiny hourglasses; orchids wearing miniature spectacles; moths carrying stitched labels; a distant walkway bends into a ribcage arch where a seated violin made of bone holds itself and silently “plays” (strings as hair, f-holes as eyes). The entire scene is serene yet adult—sensual in texture and vulnerability, never explicit—skin, paper, metal, and water sharing the same quiet dignity; joy appears as gentle collaboration with the impossible: time being played like a toy, knowledge treated like a lover, the world personifying itself to join the game. No empty horizon, no clear story, no text; every corner contains a clue that contradicts the next.
