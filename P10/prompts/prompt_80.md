Vertical 2:3 illustration inside a vast submarine cathedral perched in a bioluminescent ocean trench: towering ribbed arches like a ship’s hull, stained-glass windows replaced by living panes of jellyfish and deep-sea creatures casting prismatic light, every surface crowded with barnacled icons, coral reliquaries, rusted hymnals, prayer beads tangled with kelp, drifting soil clods and flower petals floating weightlessly as if the water has forgotten to move. In the foreground beneath a wedding canopy (a chuppah-like frame woven from brass pipe, sea-silk fabric, and luminous seaweed, held up by ceremonial gardening poles), two mythic gardeners face each other in a tense-tender pause: one kneels barefoot on a mosaic floor cracked into fertile furrows, hands cupping a handful of dark earth and seeds as if offering a vow; the other stands close, posture protective and uncertain, one hand lifting the canopy fabric like a curtain, the other holding pruning shears that subtly echo a key. Both gardeners are unmistakably faceless in an impossible, defining way—smooth head-shaped voids that behave like thresholds: where faces should be, there are open doorways/hatches into impossible interiors (a childhood bedroom, a sunlit greenhouse, a coffin-lined corridor, a starfield), each “face-door” rimmed with condensation and tiny roots, inviting and horrifying at once; their blankness reflects the cathedral’s lights like porcelain and also seems to swallow them. The cathedral’s main altar is itself a monumental doorway: a circular bulkhead-portal half-open, its rim an ouroboros (a living serpent/eel made of brass and flesh biting its tail, engraved with tiny wedding rings and seed symbols), frozen mid-uncoil as if deciding whether to seal or reveal; through the portal, gravity inverts and a garden spills upward into the nave. A lightning-struck tree dominates the midground as a charred, salt-crusted trunk growing impossibly from the altar steps, split by a white-hot fissure where a bolt is suspended inside the wood like trapped glass; faint electrical branches arc through the surrounding water without dispersing, illuminating swarms of tiny luminous fish that orbit like choirboys. Everywhere, thresholds repeat in miniature: open locket-doors in the stonework, locker doors on drowned pews, half-zipped skin-like membranes on statues, suit-helmet visors ajar with nothing behind them; faceless cherubim/divers hover among incense-bubbles that form rosary strings, and scattered gardening tools become liturgical objects (trowels as censers, seed packets as prayer cards). The overall feeling is childlike wonder edged with adult ache: warm candle-gold and bioluminescent teal mingling in soft shafts from above, dust/sea-snow glittering, the entire frame densely packed with clues in every corner, no empty space, no readable plot—only a frozen, intimate moment at a doorway that could be a marriage, a birth, a farewell, a temptation, or a return.
