Vertical 2:3 frame, crowded from edge to edge: inside a moss-sheathed hydroelectric chapel carved into a mountain cavern, an altar fused with turbine housings and ribbed penstocks like cathedral columns; shallow water covers the floor yet hangs in midair in thick sheets and beads, frozen mid-splash. In the foreground, a ferryman stands ankle-deep where the nave should be, half-submerged boat moored beside him—its hull an old wooden skiff stitched with copper coils, prayer tags, and broken gauge faces; his oar is a tarnished conductor staff. His face is hidden by a wet, reflective veil/mask that catches the chapel’s light like a blind mirror. He gently guides the enormous hand of a kneeling giant (mythic, heavy, tender; skin marked with silt and lichen; draped in a single dark cloth slipping off one shoulder like classical statuary—nude without erotic explicitness), as if teaching the giant to hold something delicate. Between their hands hovers a radiant mandala: not drawn, but “discovered,” assembling itself out of levitating parts—rust flakes turning to gold leaf, moss threads transmuting into fine wire, droplets crystallizing into glass petals—each element rotating in perfect silence. The moment of eureka is physical: a warm, relieving light pours outward from the mandala’s center, lifting weight from the scene—chains unhook themselves and float like loose handwriting, heavy stones rise as if forgiven, a pressure-door wheel spins without touching anything, and the water’s surface peels up into translucent pages. The Simurgh is present as an impossible hybrid: a vast bird shape implied by a wing made of turbine blades and luminous feathers, perched high where a choir loft would be, its eye a single lamp-lens; at the same time, smaller feather-motes drift through the air, each one half-metal, half-down, caught in the same suspended physics. A wilting bouquet is clutched near the giant’s chest—flowers browned and collapsing—yet its falling petals refuse to drop; they hover and slowly transmute into moths, coins, or tiny paper boats, ambiguous in meaning, gathering around the ferryman’s oar like a halo that can’t decide what it is. Fill every corner with readable micro-paradoxes: votive candles burning underwater; stained “glass” that is actually thin waterfalls holding colored light; prayer ribbons braided with electrical wire; fish swimming through air between floating droplets; moss growing in patterns that echo the mandala; cracked icons and control panels sharing the same frame. Keep the figures’ posture intimate but unresolved—ferryman steady and patient, giant wary and relieved—as if the entire chapel is exhaling at once, paused at the exact instant matter learns it can become something else.
