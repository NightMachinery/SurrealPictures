Vertical 2:3 illustration, worm’s-eye view from inside a dense, towering foreground ornament: an immense filigreed arch of braided thorns and hammered metal (like a ceremonial gate) rises from the bottom edge, so close it frames the scene like a cage; droplets cling to it as if time stopped mid-fall. Beyond the arch, two mythic ninjas dominate the midground—neither generic nor “action pose”: one kneels with controlled stillness on a ledge of layered petals the size of roof tiles, head bowed in a gesture that could be prayer, apology, or devotion; the other stands behind and slightly above, body angled protectively, one gloved hand gently lifting the kneeler’s chin as if checking a wound or offering a kiss through cloth. Their garments are torn in places, revealing vulnerable skin beneath; where fabric parts, growth has begun—fine vines trace along collarbones and ribs like new veins, small blossoms emerging from seams and scars, suggesting bloom as both healing and invasion. The “Frozen Dream” moment is explicit and impossible: a colossal living rose-tree (gigantic, cathedral-scale) erupts upward behind them, but its trunk subtly fuses with fauna—its bark becomes the flank of a sleeping stag-whale hybrid, and from its shoulders unfurl leaf-feather fins; enormous pollinators (moth-swans, bee-koi) hover mid-beat around it, frozen in tender orbit, their bodies half-flower, half-animal, shedding luminous pollen that hangs in the air like suspended dust. The enchanted rose is physically present and unmistakable: a single radiant bloom, too alive to be natural, floats between the ninjas’ hands as if weightless—its petals are slightly translucent and internally lit, casting soft, affectionate light onto their covered faces and the exposed skin, making the mood palpably gentle rather than ominous. The Derafsh Kaviani appears as a real banner, not a symbol: an ancient jeweled standard rises behind them, partially wrapped and rooted into the rose-tree, its fabric stitched with sunburst motifs and tassels; yet the banner’s “pole” is a living stalk that has grown through stone, blurring patriotism, body, and plant. The wilting bouquet is a counterpoint: crushed at the bottom-right corner near the viewer, half under the thorn gate, a formal hand-tied bouquet droops and browns, petals bruised, ribbon frayed—yet tiny fresh shoots pierce through the dead stems, implying growth inside decay. Crowd every layer with interpretable details: in the lower corners, scattered masks, a broken sheath filled with soil, fallen beads that resemble seeds, paper charms stuck to thorns, and a small pool reflecting the ninjas’ silhouettes incorrectly (the reflection shows them embracing in a different way than their bodies). In the background, a ruin that could be a bathhouse, palace, or greenhouse rises in terraces—arched windows clogged with vines, statues that look like lovers until they read as roots, stairways turning into branches—everything crowded with petals, feathers, and drifting threads of fabric. The atmosphere is tenderness: warm, soft light like early dawn filtered through pollen haze; no harsh shadows, only intimate glow and gentle gradations. No text, no logos; the scene should feel like a paused, emotionally-charged paradox—an image that could be rescue, surrender, mourning, or erotic devotion depending on the viewer, with every corner offering a new clue that contradicts the last.
