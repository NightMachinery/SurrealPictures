Isometric cutaway of a quiet, sacred structure sliced open like a dollhouse-temple, simultaneously showing its interior chambers and the surrounding exterior street/sky in one locked viewpoint; the entire scene is a frozen mid-event where gravity disagrees with itself—inside, a shallow pool pours upward into the ceiling while outside, a night sky “spills” downward into open rooms, and hundreds of suspended droplets, petals, dust motes, moths, and torn paper fragments hang motionless between worlds. At the compositional center, the Weaver and the Trickster face each other at intimate distance: the Weaver—partly nude, visibly scarred, serene with exhausted tenderness—kneels on a tiled threshold and draws luminous thread directly from a stitched wound at their ribs, weaving it through the air like a loom; the Trickster—beautiful, androgynous, half-smiling with a cracked porcelain mask pushed to the side—leans in as if offering comfort or mischief, holding delicate scissors and a needle that look like ceremonial relics, guiding the thread with two fingers as if teaching or sabotaging. The thread becomes the mechanism of healing/recovery across the whole cutaway: it sutures architectural cracks, binds broken mirrors back into usable reflections, laces together torn letters and medical charts, and gently restrains floating objects like a net catching memories before they shatter; some stitches look compassionate, others look controlling, so the “repair” feels holy and unsettling at once. A wilting bouquet is present as a key totem—clutched between them like a shared secret—its browned stems wrapped in fresh bandage cloth; its petals paradoxically fall upward in slow arcs, each petal turning into a tiny moth-wing, a coin, or a tear. The Derafsh Kaviani is physically integrated into the space: a large, weathered royal standard hangs diagonally through the cutaway like a backbone, partly banner, partly curtain, partly wound-dressing; its jewel-studded center is dulled, its tassels are tangled into the Weaver’s thread, and parts of the standard are being “repaired” with sutures, as if the idea of sovereignty itself is in recovery. Maintain a designed, stacked-plane layout that flattens depth into layered sections: ornate borders slice the image into interlocking panels (floorplan-like rooms, exterior facades, altar niche, stairwell, rooftop), with mosaics, talismanic diagrams, broken clocks, keys, figs, salt, hairpins, and tiny anonymous onlookers (miniature figures, cats, birds, statues that might be alive) crowded into corners; include ambiguous bodily echoes—hands emerging from wallpaper, a ribcage-shaped window, a shadow that doesn’t match either figure—so nothing resolves into a single story. Lighting and color should feel like reverent sacred silence: candle-gold and pre-dawn blue with soft haloing around stitches and suspended droplets, as if the entire world is holding its breath.
