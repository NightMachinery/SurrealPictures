Vertical 2:3 frame inside a cathedral-fortress grown from living coral and riveted brass: ribbed vaults like seashell interiors, confessionals made of portholes, organ pipes as oxidized tubes, every surface encrusted with pearls, barnacles, rosary-beads, and tiny brass hinges. In the crowded foreground, a therapist-like figure kneels on a mosaic floor that is a compass rose inlaid with mother-of-pearl and tarnished gold, using it like a ritual instrument—one hand pressing its needle gently to a sternum, the other offering a small cup of luminous “milk-light” that never spills. Facing them, close enough to share breath, a human-shaped shadow sits as if on an invisible chair: a silhouette with anatomical precision but no interior detail, edges softly fraying into drifting soot; where eyes should be, two clear glass marbles reflect the cathedral. Their interaction is intimate and unreadable—part examination, part absolution, part seduction, part rescue—fingers almost touching, a pause charged with trust and dread.

The defining impossibility: containment is broken everywhere, blatantly. Sealed reliquaries overflow without opening; closed brass boxes pour out flocks of pale paper birds; a pristine glass sphere holds a storming ocean that pushes outward into the nave while simultaneously the nave appears inside the sphere; water hangs in midair as if trapped in invisible jars, yet fish swim through the open air; a corset of brass ribs “contains” nothing but still constricts a floating, porcelain-smooth torso that remains unbroken and serene. Innocence/purity is echoed through unsettling metaphors: spotless white gloves stained only with light, a child’s lace collar folded like a fallen halo, soap-bubble membranes enclosing tiny beating hearts that remain perfectly clean, a single unblemished feather pinned to a rusted nail like a relic.

Midground: a monumental Trojan horse—coral skeleton plated in brass—wedged under an arch like a sacred siege-engine turned altar. Its belly door is visibly sealed with clasps, yet from its seams emerge impossible contents: warm bioluminescent moths, miniature nursery toys carved from bone, confession notes, and a steady ribbon of clear water that rises upward instead of falling. The horse’s flank is etched with a second compass rose, misaligned with the one on the floor, implying two incompatible norths. Background: choir stalls crowded with faceless figures in raincoats made of translucent vellum, each holding a tiny lantern that contains a smaller lantern; stained-glass windows depict anatomical diagrams of wings and cages; suspended above, an array of brass cages hangs open yet still “holds” drifting doves made of smoke.

Atmosphere and lighting: childlike wonder made tactile—pearlescent dawn filtering through salt-fog, coral polyps glowing like bedtime stars, brass catching soft honey highlights; countless floating particulates (shell dust, glittering sand, torn lace fibers, soot, petals) fill every corner so there is no empty air. Foreground corners include overlooked puzzles: a dollhouse confessional with a key already inside its locked door; a compass needle spinning inside a closed watch; a sealed bottle containing an open ocean; a clean white handprint on the shadow’s chest and a dark handprint on the therapist’s palm. Freeze the moment at maximum implication—everything mid-spill, mid-breath, mid-revelation—no text, no clear single story, only dense symbolic pressure and intimate ambiguity.
