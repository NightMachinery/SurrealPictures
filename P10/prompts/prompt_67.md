Vertical 2:3 frame, an aurora amphitheater carved into immense glacier arches, every surface crowded with carved seats, hanging banners of frost, scattered relics, and silent onlookers that could be statues or living people (masked faces, closed eyes, hands frozen mid-applause, some seated upside-down beneath the arches as if gravity forgot them). Center stage: two mythic figures sharing one fate but not one space—an aged hermit with weathered hands and a small warm lantern cupped to his sternum, and a pair of lovers rendered as one androgynous embrace, their bodies partly nude in a classical, non-explicit way, skin glazed with meltwater and wrapped in thin translucent cloth that clings like memory. The lovers are in mid-ascent, toes barely leaving the ice, yet they are also held back: their clasped hands pass through a glaring portal-slice that misplaces reality, so one hand emerges from a doorway hanging high above the amphitheater while the other remains at chest height; their embrace is “wrong” in space but perfectly tender in emotion. Around them, displacement becomes architecture—rows of seats drift upward like a flock, staircases pour into open air and re-enter the scene from impossible angles, fragments of the glacier arch hang as if suspended in a paused explosion, and several smaller portals leak objects from other rooms (a bedpost, a confession booth curtain, a banquet plate, a child’s toy, a military medal), all frozen mid-fall. A colossal Cypress of Kashmar grows improbably from the ice behind the stage, its dark trunk splitting the amphitheater like a verdict; its roots thread through the steps like veins, while its crown branches into wing-like silhouettes that echo the idea of flight without ever becoming literal wings. Suspended between hermit and lovers is a radiant golden egg, cracked just enough to show a sunlit interior that might be a miniature amphitheater, a womb, or a crown—its warm light spills across their faces with the feeling of earned glory, turning the cold scene into a private coronation. The aurora borealis is not in the sky but woven through the glacier arches like luminous curtains and ribbons, looping around pillars, snagging on masks, reflecting in puddles, casting green-blue halos that collide with the egg’s gold. Foreground corners packed with ambiguous clues: snapped shackles and open padlocks drifting like feathers, a crown half-buried in ice, a bouquet of frozen cypress needles tied with a wedding ribbon, a discarded monk’s robe threaded through a portal edge, paper notes stuck to frost with unreadable ink, a mirror shard reflecting an empty seat that feels occupied. Everything implies liberation—upward pull, broken restraints, breath held before takeoff—yet the hermit’s posture is still, proud, and unbearably intimate, as if letting go is both triumph and loss, the entire dream paused at the exact instant before the world decides where anyone belongs.
