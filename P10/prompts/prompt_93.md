Vertical 2:3 frame, packed edge-to-edge: inside a dust-buried observatory whose cracked domes yawn open like ribcages, half-swallowed by dunes, the air thick with glittering grit, torn star charts, splinters of brass gears, and suspended beads of sweat and chalk as if time stopped mid-breath. In the center, two mythic athletes share one impossible “safety”: an androgynous pole-vaulter/gymnast hangs in a perfect, strained arch mid-vault, toes pointed, ribs visible, skin powdered with chalk; below them a muscular runner/wrestler braces in a protective spotter’s stance, one knee sunk in sand, one hand steadying the other’s waist, the other hand gripping a heavy nautical anchor that should crush them—but it floats weightless, nailed to the air. From this anchor radiate taut ropes like lifelines, tying down drifting constellations: actual stars (small burning spheres) are caught in knots and pinned to the observatory’s broken telescope rings, so the ceiling becomes a net of captured night while warm daylight pours in through the domes at the same time (two times of day coexisting, both frozen). The anchor’s rope cuts through the scene like a promise and a threat: it coils around ankles like a rescue line, around wrists like restraint, around a throat like a necklace—ambiguous whether it saves or claims. Comedy and tragedy masks are physically woven into the architecture: one cracked porcelain mask is pressed to the spotter’s bare sternum as if listening for a heartbeat, the other—oxidized bronze—hangs from a dangling astrolabe, casting a smiling shadow that doesn’t match its face; smaller masks appear as riveted plates on the telescope, as sand-buried relics in the corners, as reflections in broken lens shards. A death’s-head moth is present and unmistakable yet dreamlike: perched on the gymnast’s shoulder blade like living epaulette, wings spread into a star-map pattern that aligns with the netted constellations; simultaneously, its silhouette repeats in the dust clouds and in the negative space between gears, so it feels both tiny and colossal. Foreground clutter: abandoned medals half-buried, a snapped starting pistol filled with sand, a stopwatch with its hands hovering between ticks, scattered teeth-like moon rocks, a child’s marbles reflecting galaxies, a water flask spilling droplets that hang as crystal planets. Midground: collapsed library ladders, torn velvet curtains tangled in telescope arms like seaweed, ropes threaded through eyepieces, a cracked mirror showing a third athlete who isn’t in the room. Background: domes open to a sky where stars are being reeled in like fish, while an opposite dome shows a calm nursery-blue noon; light is wondrous and curious—golden shafts, prismatic lens flares from fractured glass—yet the bodies carry adult tenderness and unease, poised between embrace and capture, rescue and surrender, with no empty space and no single readable story.
