Vertical 2:3 frame, a wide-lens viewpoint from inside a lunar tea district carved into overlapping crater rims, stacked upward like a vertical panorama of terraces, bridges, storefronts, balconies, and steep stairways; the whole scene designed as a single fused diptych—two architectural “halves” divided by an obvious seam of tiled borders and poster-like frames, yet bleeding into each other through shared shadows, mirrored objects, and repeated figures. In the dense foreground, an Artisan kneels at a low tea-workbench assembled from cracked saucers and brass tools, their posture intimate and protective, fingertips hovering near the throat and collarbone of a towering Idol seated beside them like a shrine made flesh; both figures are unmistakably faceless (not masked—smooth, featureless heads and/or open “face voids” that reveal small lit rooms, curtains, and tiny furniture inside), making the broken physics the dominant visual fact. The Artisan’s clothing is practical but ceremonial (apron, rolled sleeves, thread and wax, pockets of tea leaves and needles), while the Idol carries mythic weight—part marble, part living skin, partially nude in a vulnerable, classical way, draped in a blanket that behaves like architecture: folds become doorways, seams become streets, stitching lines become map routes; their bodies lean toward each other with gentle love, as if building a home out of touch. The theme of shelter/home is everywhere: teacups become apartments, kettles become domes, steam becomes curtains, crater walls become ribcages; small inhabitants (tea sellers, patrons, musicians, silent children, old lovers, stray animals) crowd every ledge and window, many also subtly faceless or face-obscured by reflections, veils, or blank porcelain—enough to unsettle without turning the scene into horror. An aurora borealis is physically present as a canopy woven through the district like luminous fabric and also as tea-steam rising in impossible ribbons, threading through chimneys and under eaves, bathing everything in tender, gentle light (soft lanterns, warm interiors, cool aurora highlights, no harsh contrast). The broken crown is embedded into the “roofline” near the seam of the diptych—its fractured circlet used as an arch over a doorway, shards floating like slow confetti and catching aurora light; a love letter is central and tactile: folded and refolded into an origami house in the Artisan’s hand while other pages whirl through the air, pinned to walls, stuffed into teapots, tucked under the Idol’s drapery—handwritten lines visible but not readable, like remembered words that won’t resolve. Fill all corners with clues and micro-scenes: a tiny room inside the Idol’s face-void where a kettle whistles beside an unmade bed; a balcony where two figures pour tea into each other’s cups; a street of hanging keys and dollhouse doors; paper scraps, tea leaves, crown splinters, lunar dust motes suspended mid-fall in the “frozen dream” instant; reflections in spilled tea forming alternate silhouettes; far “background” still crowded—crater rim stalls stacked to the top edge, no empty horizon, the lunar sky only glimpsed through latticework and aurora drapery. The overall feeling should be paradoxically safe and uncanny: a home being built out of absence, tenderness expressed through careful craft, and the facelessness making every emotion projectable and unresolved.
