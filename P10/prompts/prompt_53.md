Vertical 2:3 frame, a dust-buried observatory interior where sand has climbed the walls like tide-lines; cracked brass telescopes, half-submerged star globes, shattered lenses, medical instruments, wilted bouquets, salt-stiff bandages, spilled ink, and unreadable love letters swirl in the air as if gravity paused mid-breath. In the center on a tilted celestial chart-table, a mythic healer (calm, weathered, hands stained with starlight and antiseptic, hair pinned with a small astrolabe) leans over a romantist (soft, exhausted, luminous with longing, clutching a single threadbare ribbon), offering care so intimate it could be salvation or farewell: the healer’s palm cups the romantist’s jaw while the other hand gently stitches a seam of light across their sternum. The defining impossibility is anatomical and undeniable: their bodies share one continuous ribcage like an opened reliquary—two torsos joined by a single looping arch of bone and translucent skin, through which both hearts are visible, beating out of phase, one inside and one outside the body, suspended on delicate ligaments like a pendulum; extra hands emerge where shoulders should be, tenderly supporting, restraining, or blessing, making it unclear who is healing whom. Warm-sad dawn light pours through a colossal “sunrise gate” set into the far dome—an arched doorway shaped like a rising sun with radiating slats, casting long amber bars across sand and skin, freezing every drifting mote and shard in place; beyond it, the sky is only hinted at, never a clear horizon. Nearby, a true burning bush grows from a cracked marble plinth: leaves of dark velvet and mirror-glass, flames that do not consume, illuminating hidden bruises, kiss-marks, surgical scars, and constellations under the skin; some flames curl into moths, some into tiny praying hands, some into medical diagrams that dissolve before becoming legible. Crowd every corner: broken clockwork orreries mid-collapse, a toppled hospital curtain turned into a sail, a child-sized mannequin in an astronomer’s coat missing its face, a basin catching tears that look like mercury, a ladder leading nowhere, a blindfold hanging from a telescope like a lover’s tie, sand spilling upward in a thin reverse-waterfall, and in the upper dome glass, faint reflections that could be onlookers, memories, or alternate poses of the same couple. The moment must feel like a paused crisis of tenderness—almost-touch, almost-kiss, almost-surgery, almost-prayer—nostalgic warmth wrapped around quiet dread; extreme detail foreground-to-background, layered symbols, no empty space, no readable text, the scene asking a question it refuses to answer.
