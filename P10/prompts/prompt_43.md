Vertical 2:3 composition, crowded edge-to-edge: in a petrified grove where every branch is stone and every leaf is thin porcelain (some translucent, some shattered into razor confetti), a mythic Librarian and a Musician hover inches above the cracked ground as if gravity has paused mid-breath. The Librarian—timeless, ink-stained fingers, heavy-lidded eyes, draped in layered garments that resemble sewn-together book spines and loose pages—holds an open volume at chest height; instead of words, the pages contain luminous, embryonic forms (seeds, tiny hands, shells, blank faces) pushing outward like something being born. The Musician—bare-shouldered, vulnerable, adorned with delicate straps, old metal charms, and a collar-like ring of tarnished tuning pegs—cradles an instrument (ambiguous between violin/oud/harp) whose strings are literal threads of starlight; their bow hand is frozen mid-stroke, and the vibrating strings extrude glowing filaments that braid into the Librarian’s book-gutter, implying genesis as a shared act (creation as reading, creation as music, creation as intimacy). Between them, a half-burned candle floats horizontally, wax suspended in mid-drip; the wax forms miniature figures, fetuses, and melted masks that curl toward both protagonists, while the flame is impossibly bright yet silent, like a tiny sun that refuses to fall. Behind and above, the defining impossibility: the sky is descending—constellations, moons, and cloudbanks cascading downward in a vast celestial waterfall that pours through the grove, turning into glittering dust and liquid aurora as it nears the ground; the “downfall” of the heavens is frozen mid-descent, with star-fragments and comet-embers caught among porcelain leaves like ornaments. A lighthouse is embedded in the grove as if grown from it: its stone tower fused with a trunk, its lantern room cracked open like an eye; its beam is a solid, prismatic column that cuts diagonally through the scene, illuminating airborne debris—torn sheet music, feathered bookmarks, petrified birds, floating spectacles, broken hourglass grains, teeth-like seeds, and small mirrored triangles that reflect fragments of bodies and faces at odd angles. A Dharma wheel is physically present and unavoidable: partially buried in the foreground like an ancient relic yet hovering a few inches above the soil, its spokes aligned with the protagonists’ ribcage-lines; it appears to rotate (blur implied) but is perfectly still, casting a circular shadow that doesn’t match the light source, and its rim is engraved with unreadable, dreamlike glyphs (no legible text). The lighting and color should feel like blinding joy—overexposed highlights, radiant golds and opalescent whites, ecstatic prisms and halo-bloom—yet packed with tender contradictions: tears suspended like pearls, a smile that could be pain, wax that could be flesh, porcelain that could be skin. Fill all corners with micro-scenes that refuse a single story: in one corner, a tiny door in a tree-root opens onto a miniature library-altar; in another, a petrified animal wears a human wedding ring; elsewhere, a pair of hands made of porcelain leaves almost touch; a shoreline of spilled ink becomes a river of newborn stars. No empty sky, no clean horizon—everything layered (foreground shards and wax droplets, midground bodies and totems, background grove-lighthouse and the descending cosmos), extreme detail, shallow-to-deep depth cues, and a single frozen instant that feels like the exact moment the world is being born, celebrated, mourned, and rewritten all at once.
