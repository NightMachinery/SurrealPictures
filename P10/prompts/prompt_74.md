Portrait 2:3 frame, a cypress marsh so dense it feels like an interior: knotted cypress knees crowd the foreground like knuckles, Spanish moss hangs in heavy curtains, the water is mirror-dark yet impossibly **solid**—a petrified surface with ripples frozen mid-swell, cracked like obsidian. At center, a mythic **therapist** sits with effortless, unsettling composure on a floating shrine that resembles a therapy chaise fused to an altar; their expression is serene, almost tender, eyes half-lidded in perfect contentment, one hand offering a small notebook whose pages are translucent and wet, the other hand holding a palm-sized **lighthouse** that emits a calm, milk-warm beam. The therapist is simultaneously **duplicated**: three near-identical versions of them occupy the same space, slightly phase-shifted like overlapping exposures—one clothed in crisp, archaic ceremonial layers, one draped in damp gauze revealing classical anatomy without erotic explicitness, one made of the marsh itself (skin as bark, veins as rootlets), all sharing the same tranquil face yet with subtly mismatched details (extra finger, inverted buttonholes, a stethoscope that becomes a rosary, a smile that is almost stitched). Around them, dozens of **floating shrines** hover at different heights, crowded with ambiguous offerings—teeth in teacups, wedding rings on reeds, tiny masks, cracked mirrors, prescription bottles filled with fireflies, pearls tangled in moss, anatomical wax hearts—each shrine duplicated in faint echo-shadows that don’t align with any light source. A colossal **tidal wave** rises in the background but is paused in absolute stillness, not water but solid liquidity: a towering, glassy wall whose crest is sculpted like poured mercury, with suspended droplets like beads and air-bubbles containing miniature scenes (a door slightly ajar, a childhood room, an empty bed) that refuse to resolve into a story. The lighthouse beam cuts through the wave and reveals a slow storm of **death’s-head moths**: some the size of hands, some the size of faces, their wing-skulls eerily clear; they cling to the therapist’s collarbones like living brooches, drift through the moss like ash, and one enormous moth rests on a shrine like a veil, its wings patterned with faint inkblot symmetries that mirror the therapist’s duplicated silhouettes. In every corner, add crowded paradoxical micro-details—floating therapy chairs with roots instead of legs, reeds that grow from porcelain ears, water-solidified tears suspended mid-fall, reflections that show a different therapist than the one above—yet the overall mood remains tranquil, hushed, and warmly lit as if the entire grotesque impossibility is a comfort no one can explain.
