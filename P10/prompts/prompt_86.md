Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded customs-cathedral interior where every surface is bureaucratic ornament: vaults and columns tiled with visas, watermarks, seals, and thin gold borders; long queues of travelers, clerks, and witnesses packed into foreground/midground/background, all holding blank passports like fragile icons. At the center sits the Shah—mythic and exhausted—half in ceremonial regalia, half in a rumpled modern suit, heavy crown shaped like a compass rose; he leans forward as if judging an invisible sentence, one hand gripping a paintbrush like a scepter, the other offering an open passport-page as if it were a tongue. Flanking him are the Twins, mirror-born but not identical: one poised and serene, one tense and feral; their bodies are partly draped in translucent fabrics printed with map-lines and exit stamps, skin marked with faint passport-photo rectangles and handwritten signatures; they touch the Shah in contradictory ways (one Twin gently covering his eyes with paint-stained fingers, the other tugging his sleeve as if to pull him up and out), their gazes aimed past the viewer toward something missing. The defining impossible event is literal metaphor made physical: in the exact center of the floor, a perfectly circular “stamp” of pure black has been painted—yet it behaves as a real void, a flat ink-blot hole that drinks light, luggage tags, petals, and fragments of language; paint drips run toward it uphill; torn passport pages orbit it like moths. Vitality explodes everywhere despite the dread: wet pigments bloom into living things—ink becomes schools of fish in midair, crimson becomes pomegranates cracking open into confetti, green becomes fast vines threading through iron railings—while tiny sparks of gold leaf lift off documents like breath. The Trojan Horse is present as a monumental checkpoint booth built into a wooden horse’s torso, cutaway like a dollhouse: inside, miniature officials paint passports with fine brushes, and inside them again, nested scenes repeat—endless interior checkpoints within checkpoints. A towering lighthouse rises where a cathedral pillar should be, its lantern casting a beam that is not light but a solid, climbable ribbon of passport paper and painted signatures; the beam bends at right angles, pinning the space into stacked layers, and its edge slices through figures without harming them, creating clean “panel” separations. Encode time as a time-lapse collage: repeated phases of the Shah and the Twins appear in adjacent planes (the Shah’s hand reaching / hovering / retracting; the Twins embracing / separating / swapping positions), echoed like sequential beats across mosaic tiles, luggage labels, and halo-like afterimages; smaller repeated gestures ripple through the crowd (a clerk dipping a brush again and again, a traveler turning a page in three positions). Flatten depth with stacked decorative planes: ornate borders of stamps frame micro-scenes in the corners (a passport painted with a face that isn’t the holder’s; a lighthouse trapped in a seal; a horse silhouette hiding a doorway), while foreground objects overlap like cutouts—hands, brushes, ropes, papers, flowers, keys, feathers, tickets—so the frame feels overfull, intimate, and claustrophobically designed. Keep the emotional question unresolved: tenderness, shame, desire, and quiet dread all legible at once, with the void acting like both a censor’s stamp and an invitation.
