Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded carnival-circus necropolis at “night” where phosphorescent ticket booths glow like aquarium tanks between mausoleums and striped funeral tents; the foreground is carpeted with overlapping relics—torn ticket stubs stamped with impossible dates, heirloom jewelry tangled in rosary beads, baby shoes beside wedding veils, cracked mirrors, dentures and pearls, wilted bouquets that sprout fresh buds, confetti mixed with ash—everything suspended mid-tumble as if the air itself has been paused. Center stage: a nude-to-partially-draped Idol on a pedestal that is also a marble ticket window, skin marked by faint seam-lines like inherited patterns, expression serene yet exhausted; two Twins press close as if both worshipping and restraining—identical faces, but one bears youthful softness while the other carries the same features aged and sharpened, their bodies mirroring in opposite tension, hands at the Idol’s throat and sternum in a gesture that could be coronation, comfort, or theft. Between their palms burns the Eternal Flame of Atar: a small, unwavering fire that does not consume its wick, yet throws huge contradictory shadows—ancestors, descendants, and the Idol’s own silhouettes at different ages—casting them across tombstones shaped like carnival prizes. The Open Hand motif dominates the architecture: a colossal stone hand rises from the ground as the main platform, palm up, fingers forming arches; inside its palm sits a miniature repeating version of the same carnival-necropolis, implying endless inheritance. The Time Collapse is blatant and physical: a ferris wheel fused with an hourglass hangs in the sky, its gondolas showing the same figures in different eras; carousel horses exist in multiple states at once (freshly painted, skeletal, and blooming with flowers), and ribbons, playing cards, moths, and coins hang frozen while some drift upward, some sideways, some in spirals; every ticket booth window displays a different “now” with mismatched lighting (dawn, dusk, candlelit, neon), as if the scene has been stitched from incompatible moments. Midground crowds of ambiguous half-figures—masked mourners, circus performers, stone angels with clown collars, lovers embracing like statues, a child-sized undertaker juggling bones—are caught in contradictory expressions (laughter and grief on the same face), forming a dense visual puzzle in every corner. Whimsical absurdity saturates the mood: glowing phosphor signage promises impossible attractions (“RETURN POLICY,” “FAMILY NAME,” “SECOND CHANCE”), balloons float like organs, and a prize booth displays framed fingerprints instead of toys. No clear story, only a single frozen instant overflowing with legacy, desire, shame, tenderness, dread—layered depth, no empty space, every surface packed with symbols and small discoveries.
