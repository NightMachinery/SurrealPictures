Vertical 2:3, full-bleed: on a crowded sky-reef of drifting stone islands (coral-like rock, broken temples, hanging gardens, suspended staircases), a mythic Shah and a weary Inventor share a suspended moment of care—foreheads almost touching, the Shah’s heavy jeweled mantle half-slipped to reveal bare shoulder and old scars, one hand cupping the Inventor’s jaw with unmistakable tenderness while the other steadies the Inventor’s trembling, ink-stained fingers; the Inventor, in cracked goggles and a stitched leather apron over vulnerable, partially nude classical anatomy, gently fastens a delicate device at the Shah’s chest like a heart-tuning instrument, as if repairing dignity itself. The defining impossibility: portal displacement tears through the scene in multiple oval rifts of impossible depth—objects and body-fragments are spatially “misfiled”: the Shah’s shadow emerges from a portal behind the Inventor and climbs upward across open air; the Inventor’s right hand reaches through a portal and reappears far above, sprinkling fine sand that should belong to an hourglass; a stone doorway on a distant island opens directly into the immediate foreground, spilling fragments of another sky. The Sword-in-the-Stone is present but paradoxical: the sword is embedded in a boulder on a midground island, yet its hilt protrudes through a nearby portal beside the Shah’s hip as if the same sword exists in two places at once; the Shah’s ringed finger almost brushes the hilt without claiming it. The Eternal Flame of Atar burns impossibly clean inside a transparent reliquary (glass-and-gold), and the flame’s light casts ecstatic, blinding joy across everything—prismatic glare, halos, iridescent mist—yet the flame is also seen through a portal in the sky as a vast sunlike fire far away, synchronized with the small flame as if one breath feeds both. An hourglass floats between them, cracked and repaired with fine wire; its sand falls upward in one chamber and downward in the other, with grains crossing portals mid-fall, forming a glittering suspended spiral around their hands. Crowd every corner: drifting debris of blueprints, prayer ribbons, gears, petals, and tiny mirror shards; clockwork birds carrying threads; miniature statues with missing faces; floating medical linens; a distant island shaped like a reclining body; ladders that lead into open air; water droplets orbiting like pearls. The entire frame is a frozen climax of impossible motion—everything mid-swish, mid-fall, mid-breath—yet perfectly still, inviting multiple, conflicting readings of power, devotion, shame, salvation, theft, and joy without resolving into a single story. No text, no borders, no empty sky; dense foreground/midground/background detail.
