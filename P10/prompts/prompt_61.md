Vertical 2:3 illustration designed like a vintage tarot card: an ornate, timeworn frame with crowded margins packed with tiny inset scenes, glyphs, gears, moth wings, stitched ribbon, stray keys, cracked beads, pressed flowers, and miniature hands offering and receiving objects; the center “main panel” is a calm chamber of stacked planes (like a collage stage set) where a mythic clockmaker and an oracle face each other in intimate stillness—both timeless, neither fully young nor old. The clockmaker kneels on a mosaic of clockfaces and vertebrae-like clock springs, bare forearms dusted with gold filings, wearing a half-apron of translucent fabric and pocketwatch chains; their expression is tender, exhausted, reverent. The oracle sits upright on a throne that looks upholstered yet geological, draped in a thin veil that clings like water, serene eyes half-lidded, one hand gently cupping the clockmaker’s jaw as if blessing or judging. Between them: an offering that is unmistakably a “gift” but impossible to define—an open palm presenting a small, luminous mechanism shaped like a seed/heart/compass; the air around it reacts as if generosity has weight: nearby objects lean inward, cracks in porcelain mend themselves, wilted petals rehydrate, and faint halos form around shared touchpoints. The defining broken logic is blatant duplication: the gift duplicates mid-air into a cascading chain of identical-yet-not-identical copies (each slightly shifted in age, patina, and meaning), and the two figures also duplicate as faint, overlapping “echo-bodies” in the same pose—three clockmakers layered a hair’s breadth apart, three oracles misregistered like a printing error—so the viewer can’t tell which version is real; duplicated shadows fall in different directions while everything remains frozen and perfectly calm. A skull is physically present and unavoidable: not a prop but part of the architecture—a pale skull carved into the base of a workbench/altar, its eye sockets housing tiny ticking moons; the clockmaker’s tools rest across its brow like a crown, and one duplicated shadow turns the skull into a mask over the oracle’s face for a second reading. Pandora’s box is also present in the center, held between them like a fragile treaty: a small, ornate box with a hinged lid cracked open, serene light spilling out—not chaos, but an orderly drift of duplicated contents (feathers, teeth, pearls, wedding-ring shapes, needles, fig leaves, letters without words) rising in slow suspension and then re-entering the box from impossible angles, as if giving and taking are the same loop. Fill foreground/midground/background with tactile clutter and quiet evidence—threaded constellations pinned to the frame, hourglasses filled with milk, mirrored watch hands that point at each other, duplicated keys embedded in the border like a rosary—every corner contains a secondary metaphor that contradicts the main one. Lighting is deep calm: soft, even, pearly illumination like early dawn through frosted glass, no harsh drama; despite the density, the mood is tranquil and emotionally intelligent, inviting readings of tenderness, shame, grief, ecstasy, or dread without ever landing on a single literal story.
