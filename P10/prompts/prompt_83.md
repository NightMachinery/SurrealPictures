Vertical 2:3 frame, inside a labyrinthine embassy that is also a mirror maze: corridors of angled glass, gilded treaty tables, rival heraldic sigils repeating into infinity, every reflection slightly “wrong” (different scars, different jewelry, different emotions), the air crowded with suspended fragments—shattered mirror triangles, drifting wax seals, floating chess pieces, ribbons of incense smoke, torn pages of peace accords folding into origami birds. Center foreground: two mythic figures locked in an almost-touch—an androgynous Avatar traveler with dust on bare shoulders beneath a half-unfastened ceremonial cuirass, skin mapped with faint cartographic tattoos and old bite-marks, holding a childlike trinket-compass that points to the other person; facing them, the Oracle—tall, veiled, barefoot on nothing, a blindfold that seems woven from starlight and mourning cloth, palms ink-stained as if from prophecy, posture calm but intimate, as if listening with the whole body. Their closeness is paradoxical: their fingertips meet through a vertical portal that has displaced the space between them—one hand is in the “wrong” place, emerging from a mirror two meters away, so the pair are simultaneously separated and embracing; their shared breath condenses as a visible thread that loops through multiple mirrors and returns to their mouths, tying them together like a single exhale. The defining impossible event is frozen mid-breach: several doorways and mirror-panels hang in midair like open books, each portal misaligned—showing parts of other rooms (a throne room, a nursery, a battlefield, a bath, a courtroom) and displacing objects through them (a goblet pouring upward into nowhere, a crown drifting down through a wall, a flock of moths exiting a diplomat’s sleeve), while the entire embassy’s central carpet levitates in a gentle arc, its underside revealing a luminous mandala mosaic that has peeled free from the floor and now floats above the figures like a halo-circuit diagram, casting lace-like shadows across skin and glass. Woven through the architecture is the Cypress of Kashmar: a colossal, ancient cypress growing indoors, trunk threading through mirror planes as if the building cannot decide which world contains it; roots snake around treaty legs and disappear into portals; branches carry tiny lantern-fruits and prayer-knots, their needles shedding emerald sparks that drift like fireflies. Wonder permeates the lighting: prismatic refractions, soft dawn-glow trapped in glass, rainbow caustics sliding over faces, luminous dust motes around the clasped hands, making the moment feel like forbidden discovery rather than horror. Fill every depth layer with ambiguous witnesses and clues: midground masked envoys (half-child, half-elder) holding pens like daggers; a guard’s shadow that doesn’t match its body; a pair of swans made of folded parchment drinking spilled ink; a small mirror on the floor reflecting the viewer’s eye; coins orbiting an empty ring-box; a bouquet of cypress sprigs tied with a ribbon that becomes an umbilical cord in one reflection; in the far background, rival thrones facing each other across an endless corridor, yet in one mirror they are pushed together like lovers’ chairs. Corners crowded with micro-stories that don’t resolve: a fingertip print on fogged glass shaped like a mandala petal, a cracked seal that resembles a mouth, a child’s toy soldier levitating beside a holy relic, droplets of water hovering like pearls between two nearly-kissing profiles—everything poised in a single suspended heartbeat, asking what “closeness” costs and what it saves without ever answering.
