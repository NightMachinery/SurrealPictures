Vertical 2:3, full-bleed “frozen dream” tableau inside a colossal, altar-like coastal cathedral carved from moonstone and wet driftwood; perfectly symmetrical frontal composition (central aisle, twin columns, mirrored stairways, paired braziers) but with unsettling hidden asymmetries (one column subtly cracked like a vertebra, one brazier burning salt instead of incense, one staircase missing a single step, one side strewn with pomegranate seeds while the other has pearls). At the center, an ageless Mentor—an adult figure of impossible scale, barefoot and kneeling so their shoulders eclipse the vaulted ceiling—leans forward with the gravity of a mountain, palms open in a gesture that could be blessing, surrender, or apology; opposite them, the Dreamer—clearly adult, smaller yet luminous—stands on the altar table itself, steadying themselves by touching the Mentor’s thumb as if holding onto a shoreline. Between their hands: an offering that embodies gratitude without being literal—a steaming, heart-shaped loaf made of starlight and wheat husk, cracked open to reveal tiny constellations, moth wings, and handwritten thank-you notes that dissolve into fireflies before you can read them (no legible text). A friendship bracelet is physically present and central: a braided thread-cord wrapped around the Dreamer’s wrist, looping around the Mentor’s finger, and then threading through the architecture like rigging—its strands become taut lines that hold objects in suspension (spoons, dried flowers, keys, teeth-like shells, wedding rings, prayer beads), implying bonds, debts, and tenderness all at once. The Derafsh Kaviani appears as a monumental jeweled banner-staff planted behind the altar like a sacred standard; its fabric is heavy with gems and stitched fragments of many eras (metal, velvet, scar tissue, seaweed), draped in a way that echoes wings and a shroud simultaneously, catching cosmic light like a night sky pinned into cloth. Behind everything, the defining broken logic: a tidal wave of impossible gigantism, arrested mid-curl as if time stopped at the instant of impact—its translucent wall contains floating furniture, autumn leaves, shattered mirrors, and small figures reaching upward; the wave’s inner surface reflects the altar scene like a second, contradictory reality. Atmosphere of awe at cosmic scale: an eclipse-like backlight crowns the Mentor’s head with a thin halo-rim; aurora-colored god-rays cut through sea mist and incense smoke; dust, salt crystals, and embers drift in the air like slow snowfall. Crowd every layer: foreground littered with offerings and relics (harvest fruits split open, candle wax shaped like fingers, tarnished medals, cracked porcelain masks, wet feathers, braided hair ribbons, seashells arranged like a jawbone); midground populated by tiny pilgrims and faceless attendants (adult silhouettes) carrying bowls of water, empty plates, and bundles of letters; background filled with impossible architecture—archways opening onto starfields, staircases descending into the ocean, chandeliers made of drift nets and bones. The overall moment must read as a paused exchange—gratitude as a force that holds catastrophe in place—tender contact amid overwhelming scale, sacred and intimate at once, emotionally ambivalent, densely detailed, and interpretable in many conflicting ways; no gore, no explicit sex, no children, no readable text, no modern logos.
