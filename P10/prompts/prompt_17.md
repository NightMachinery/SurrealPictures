A volcanic plateau made of interlocking obsidian mirrors with no visible horizon—every direction crowded by labyrinthine architecture grown from reflective basalt: staircases that fold into book spines, corridors made of stacked drawers of index cards, archways whose keystones are cracked lenses, and a maze-floor of inlaid mirror tiles that repeat the scene with tiny mismatched errors; at the center, a mythic Beast (horned, leonine shoulders, ember-glowing ribs, skin alternating between velvet fur and cracked volcanic stone) stands in a triumphant, protective posture as if mid-crowning, one claw gently bracing the chin/neck of a solemn Librarian (androgynous, ink-stained hands, bare back partially draped in stitched parchment and catalog tags, keyring of tiny brass bookmarks at the hip), their gaze locked like a vow and a verdict at once—tenderness and domination impossible to separate; physics is loudly broken: the sky has shattered into floating panes and torn constellations, and a “celestial descent” is frozen mid-fall—star-mapped marble fragments, cathedral ribs, and moonlit dust cascading downward but suspended as if caught in honey, each fragment reflecting alternate versions of the pair; the labyrinth itself is fragmenting: corridors break into prisms, walls become page-tears, and the mirrors show discontinuous body fragments (a hand on a different wrist, an eye looking the wrong way, a shadow arriving before its owner), implying many selves and many timelines; weave the three totems into the protagonists and the maze—an open music box nested in the Beast’s sternum like a reliquary (its ballerina replaced by a small rotating all-seeing eye), a large stopped clock embedded in the floor at their feet with its hands snapped at an ambiguous “almost,” and a colossal all-seeing eye implied in the environment (iris formed by a spiral labyrinth of shelves; pupil a volcanic vent exhaling glittering ash); enforce “nested windows” as the composition logic: mirror panels, broken clock glass, and floating book-pages form overlapping frames within frames, each window containing an alternate micro-narrative that is readable but unresolved (a court witness stand made of library ladders; a lovers’ embrace seen only as reflections; a child-sized figure offering a book to an empty chair; a funeral veil turning into sheet music; a victory parade of faceless masks), all partially occluded and contradicting each other; foreground packed with suspended debris—paper birds, catalog cards, gears, hairpins, petals of black glass, molten droplets like pearls—midground dense with mirrored arches and shelf-mazes; background crowded by rising mirror cliffs and lava-light that grades the whole scene into victorious elation: warm golds and ember-pinks cutting through cool obsidian blues, celebratory radiance in the ash like confetti, yet every reflection hints at shame, longing, grief, ecstasy; everything captured at the exact instant before impact—frozen, ringing, breath held—an emotionally charged paradox that refuses a single story.
