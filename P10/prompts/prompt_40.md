Vertical 2:3 frame, a crowded paradoxical festival inside a palatial hall that is also a half-ruined shrine: vaulted arches draped in garlands of bells and hair-thin ribbons, floor tiled like an enormous mandala, every surface cluttered with cups, masks, fruit, bones, petals, dice, keys, feathers, burnt matchsticks, and tiny mirrored shards catching light. At center, two mythic Avatars face each other in a frozen almost-embrace / almost-duel: one stands barefoot on a banquet table with the calm weight of a judge, body partly veiled by translucent sashes and ceremonial jewelry, gaze tender but unreadable; the other kneels on one knee as if proposing or pleading or preparing to strike, their hands hovering millimeters from touching—between their palms hangs a small glowing object that could be a heart, a stolen gem, or a compact sun. Around them the celebration has become mischief made physical: objects are unmistakably personified and acting like guests—champagne bottles with human throats and collarbones tilt back in laughter, a candelabrum bends at the waist to whisper into a goblet’s “ear,” a drum in the corner wears a cracked smile and offers its own skin like a toast, a ladder in stockings dances with a chair, a bouquet reaches out like fingers to steal a ring, a mask bites another mask, and a ribbon garrote-plays at being a snake while still remaining a ribbon. The Eternal Flame of Atar burns in a prominent brazier built into the architecture (unmissable, sacred, alive), yet its fire behaves like celebratory confetti—sparks hang in the air as suspended petals and tiny moths, illuminating faces and hands with wicked warmth; above, a large Dharma Wheel (eight-spoked) is physically present as a chandelier/halo hybrid, its spokes threaded with beads and small offerings, casting radial shadows that slice the crowd into ambiguous scenes. Foreground packed with tactile clues: toppled cake shaped like a temple, a wine spill forming a map or a stain of shame, a pair of clasped hands emerging from a pile of clothing that may be empty or inhabited, a broken mirror reflecting an eye that isn’t in the room, a single shoe filled with ash, confetti that looks like teeth if you stare too long. Midground teems with revelers that might be human, statue, or furniture—some half-nude but classically posed and strategically obscured by fabrics, hands, and props; expressions oscillate between ecstasy, grief, and prankish complicity. Background corners remain busy: balconies crowded with silent onlookers made of curtains and glass, a doorway opening onto a night sky that seems indoors, a fountain pouring sand upward, and floating debris (petals, coins, nails, tiny bells) suspended as if time stopped mid-toast; no readable text, no modern signage—everything intimate, ritualistic, and teasingly indecipherable, like a memory that refuses to settle into one story.
