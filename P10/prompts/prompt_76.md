Vertical 2:3 frame, a full-body double-portrait staged like an altar inside a moss-choked hydroelectric chapel hollowed into mountain caverns: penstocks, sluice gates, cables, prayer-rails, and turbine housings twist into an ornamental labyrinth that cages and frames the protagonists. At the center, a timeless Matchmaker stands barefoot on wet stone, half cleric/half engineer/half seducer, draped in layered cloth and wiring like a stole; their face is calm but conspiratorial, eyes glittering with gleeful trouble. They guide a Dancer who is caught mid-turn—torso arched, throat exposed, one leg lifted as if stepping onto invisible music—skin luminous, ornamented with damp petals and fine cracks of light; the pose reads equally as intimate instruction, reluctant surrender, and mutual dare. The “frozen dream” impossibility dominates: the entire chapel (and parts of both bodies) is fragmented into dozens of suspended, misaligned slices—stone ribs, stained-glass panels, turbine blades, and even expressions split into offset facets—yet everything is perfectly still, as if time shattered instead of space; between the floating fragments, water hangs in beads and ribbons, reflecting tiny inverted scenes that don’t match the main one. A sudden “eureka” is implied by the environment reacting: a thin, brilliant seam of discovery tears open through the labyrinth like a diagram coming alive—electric filaments and luminous moss tracing hidden circuits, revealing impossible connections; the Matchmaker’s fingers pinch a tiny spark/match-flame that does not burn but illuminates, casting mischievous, prismatic shadows that grin from the corners. The Cypress of Kashmar is physically present as a colossal cypress growing through the turbine altar—ancient trunk wrapped in copper coils and ivy, roots drinking from the channel, branches threaded with prayer-tags and breaker-switches—its silhouette repeated in miniature as carved motifs and mirrored reflections. A wilting bouquet is clutched between the two figures like a secret withering in real time: bruised flowers shedding dark petals that float upward against gravity, each petal carrying faint engraved symbols, love-notes, or engineering schematics depending on how you look. A flying kite roams the cavern ceiling where no wind should be, its paper skin patched from hymn pages and blueprint vellum; its string snakes through the fragmented architecture, tangles around wrists/ankles like a playful restraint, stitches fragments together, then vanishes behind levitating stone—suggesting either rescue, sabotage, or flirtation. Fill every plane with clues and misdirection: side alcoves packed with damp votive candles made of porcelain insulators, moths orbiting tiny arcs of electricity, rusted locks without doors, masks hanging from pipework, mirrored pairs of hands reaching from cracks, turbine-water forming suspended halos, moss blooming in the shapes of fingerprints, and distant silhouettes behind gauze-thin waterfalls that might be statues or witnesses. The overall feeling is crowded, intimate, and teasing—tenderness and dread sharing the same breath—an image that looks like it’s about to resolve into an answer, but instead keeps splitting into more questions.
