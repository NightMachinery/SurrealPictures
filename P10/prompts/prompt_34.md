Vertical 2:3 composition from an extreme low viewpoint as if the viewer is kneeling on cold stone: the foreground is a crowded still-life plane—spilled pomegranate seeds mixed with pearl buttons, a tarnished medal half-buried in ash, a single ivory glove holding a cracked mirror shard, wedding rings caught in thorny twine, a small votive lamp burning inside a glass lung, hairpins, broken rosary beads, a ribbon of gauze that looks like skin when it folds—everything arranged like a deliberate altar yet slightly wrong, with tiny shadows that don’t match their objects. In the midground, two twins dominate the frame on a monumental plinth before gigantic architecture (towering arches, reliefs, stairways, and niches) that feels ceremonial and ancient: they are unmistakably related but not identical—one upright and crowned with quiet authority, one leaning in close as if whispering a secret verdict; their bodies are classically beautiful yet uncannily altered (a subtle extra joint, a seam of gold kintsugi-like cracks across collarbone and cheek, a second set of hands emerging from sleeves like a mistaken memory, their shared shadow braided into a single figure). Their intimacy reads as protection, rivalry, devotion, or possession depending on the viewer; their expressions are proud in a hard-earned way—exalted but exhausted—skin marked by healed bruises, faint ritual ink, and the dull shine of triumph. Above and behind them, a wedding canopy is physically present but impossible: its four poles are fragments of a broken column, splintered and bandaged with silk, and the canopy itself becomes the entire “sky replacement”—the real sky is gone, replaced by a vast suspended textile horizon that stretches to infinity like a ceiling, stitched with constellations, anatomical diagrams, and faint court scenes; it billows without wind, and its underside reveals another world (upside-down steps, drifting chandeliers, a tide of floating letters, distant hands reaching from nowhere) so the heavens feel like an interior room turned inside out. A colossal Simurgh is integrated into the architecture and the canopy at once—part living bird, part mosaic, part smoke—perched like a guardian-judge on a high cornice, with feathers that resolve into hundreds of tiny faces, eyes, and wedding veils; several feathers fall midair in frozen motion, each feather reflecting a different moment (a kiss, a coronation, a funeral, an empty bed) without confirming any single story. Crowd every corner with paradoxical details that reward rereading: statues with missing mouths holding trumpets that emit flowers, a procession of masked figures carved into the walls but stepping out as paper cutouts, a laurel wreath made of razor blades, a river of wine flowing upward into a cracked chalice embedded in the broken column, moths arranged like medals across the twins’ shoulders, and torn banners whose text is illegible but feels accusatory. Lighting is luminous and triumphant—warm, gilded, almost celebratory—yet it sharpens every unsettling texture; the entire scene is designed like stacked planes and framed panels (mosaic borders, inset “mini-scenes,” flattened depth cues) so it reads as a curated dream-collage: exalted, intimate, grotesque, and unresolved.
