# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
40. **An astronomer lowers a telescope and carefully cups something fallen from the sky** + **the “meteor” is a sleeping seed that sprouts a tiny tree whose leaves are crescent moons, bending gravity around the astronomer’s boots** + **a hilltop observatory terrace: brass instruments, stone balustrade, scattered notebooks with blank pages, windblown cloaks on hooks, a small garden of hardy shrubs, and a valley of lights far below** + **deep night with crisp starlight and faint aurora, soft glow from the sprouting moons, hushed awe** + **oil painting, luminous night palette, magical realism, no text, no letters, no typography** + **--ar 2:3**
