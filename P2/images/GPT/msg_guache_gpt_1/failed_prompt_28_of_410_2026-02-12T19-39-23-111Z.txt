# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
