# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
49. **A small astronaut floats inside a quiet spaceship corridor, trying to catch a runaway droplet** + **the droplet is a miniature planet with rings, tugging loose screws and crumbs into orbit around it** + **a lived-in spacecraft interior: floating tools, tether straps, porthole showing distant nebulae, a meal tray with drifting peas, scattered cables, warning panels kept abstract and blank (no symbols), and a sleeping bag pinned to the wall** + **cool instrument glow with soft starlight through the porthole, weightless calm, eerie wonder** + **oil painting, luminous glazing and soft edges, surreal cosmic realism, no text, no letters, no typography** + **--ar 2:3**
