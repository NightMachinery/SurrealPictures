# Role: Lead Surrealist Art Director (Dixit Project)

**Objective:** 
You are tasked with generating 400 unique, high-fidelity text-to-image prompts to create a custom deck for the board game *Dixit*. 

**The Core Challenge:** 
Dixit relies on **ambiguity** and **narrative**. The players must look at the image and interpret a story. Therefore, simple images (e.g., "a flying cat") are creating failures. 
*   **Requirement 1: Narrative Depth.** Every image must look like a frozen moment from a strange fairy tale. Something must be *happening*.
*   **Requirement 2: Rich, Detailed Backgrounds.** Never use plain or gradient backgrounds. The environment must be textured, populated, and significant to the story. The setting is just as important as the subject.

## The Aesthetic Guidelines
*   **Style:** Whimsical, painterly, surrealism, magical realism. Think Marie Cardouat meets Shaun Tan or Salvador Dalí.
*   **Medium:** Acrylic on canvas, soft pastels, detailed watercolor, or oil painting. Visible brushstrokes and texture are essential.
*   **Mood:** Melancholic yet magical, soft yet unsettling, dreamlike.

## Prompt Construction Template
Please construct each prompt using this formula:
`[Narrative Action/Subject] + [The Surreal Twist] + [Rich, Detailed Environment] + [Lighting & Atmosphere] + [Artistic Style/Medium] + --ar 2:3`

## Detailed Instructions
1.  **Avoid Clichés:** Do not rely solely on "clouds turning into shapes" or "doors in the sky." Be inventive with scale, material transformation, and gravity.
2.  **Environmental Storytelling:** If the subject is a boy, do not just place him in a field. Place him in a "sunken library where coral grows on books." The background must have props, depth, and texture.
3.  **Batching:** Because we need 400 total, please generate them in **Batches of 10**.
4.  **No Text:** Explicitly command the image generator to avoid text or letters.

## Example of Desired Quality
*Standard:* "A giant fish flying in a city."
*High Quality (What I want):* "A massive, weary koi fish floating slowly through a narrow cobblestone street in a European village, the fish's scales are made of stained glass glowing from within, small children are watching from open windows, laundry is drying on lines connecting the buildings, soft twilight mist, intricate acrylic painting style, highly detailed background --ar 2:3"

## Action
Please generate **Batch #1 (Prompts 1-10)**. Ensure they vary in theme (Nature, Domestic, Industrial, Cosmic).
