**Text-to-image prompt:** A crowded, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit card, “Frozen Dream” still frame) inside a **gilded banquet nave** where the aisle is a long feast-table and the vaulted ceiling is a cathedral turned dining hall: **silverware levitates everywhere**—forks, knives, spoons, goblets—caught mid-orbit like a silent chandelier of utensils, each reflecting calm candlelight. At the center foreground stands the **mythic Phoenix & the Child** as a single paradoxical protagonist: a serene child (timeless, gender-ambiguous, classical proportions, vulnerable but not eroticized) barefoot on a mosaic of bone-white plates, their posture gentle and priestlike, while a phoenix made of ember-feathers and thin gold leaf unfurls behind them like a haloed mantle; the phoenix’s wings form an arch that resembles stained glass, yet the feathers are **soft-sculpture cloth**, folding like velvet curtains. The child cradles a **shared cup** (one chalice with two rims) pressed to their sternum; one rim holds clear water, the other holds ash—both perfectly still—implying communion and return. A **half-burned candle** is fused into the child’s palm as if grown there: wax becomes architectural mortar, dripping upward into delicate flying buttresses; the flame is paused mid-flicker, illuminating neither smoke nor heat, only a hush. The nave’s columns are an impossible **architecture/nature fusion**: living **Cypress of Kashmar** trunks rise through the gilded stone, yet the “stone” sags and gathers like upholstered fabric, as though the entire cathedral is a pliable ceremonial costume—carved cherubs slumping like soft clay, cornices drooping in elegant folds, vines stitched into filigree. The **ritual/cycle** theme is everywhere but never literal: repeating concentric circles of plates, rings of floating cutlery like orbital calendars, a procession of identical place settings that subtly age from pristine silver to tarnish to gold again, and floor mosaics that loop back on themselves like a quiet ouroboros. Fill every corner with clues: cracked pomegranates releasing tiny moths, pearls caught in midair between goblets, folded napkins shaped like sleeping birds, wax seals on menus with no readable text, relic-like crumbs glittering like stars. The atmosphere is **deep calm serenity**—cool moonlit blues and warm antique golds, soft diffusion, no harsh contrast, a sacred silence; faces and feathers are tranquil, eyes reflective, no overt narrative resolution. In the background, high in the apse, a veil of slow-falling snow drifts indoors; **subtle easter egg:** the snowflakes (and/or a woven rug pattern beneath the table) align into a faint **palace floor-plan** only visible on close inspection. Ultra-detailed, layered depth (foreground/midground/background all busy), surreal symbolism, paradox, emotionally intelligent stillness, no empty space, no text, no watermark, no modern logos.
