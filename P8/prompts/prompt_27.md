Portrait-format, borderless Dixit card illustration: inside an **orbiting chapel** so dense it feels alive—vaulted arches braided with banyan roots and coral, marble columns blooming into lilies and barnacles, constellations trapped in stained glass—where a **freestanding doorway-threshold** splits reality like a surgical seam: one side a warm, toybox glow of impossible “home,” the other a cold starfield nave with drifting incense and frozen breath; at the exact midpoint stands a mythic **Guardian-Dancer**, androgynous and timeless, poised in a suspended pirouette (one bare foot on each world), torso partly nude like a classical statue yet armored with fractured moon-silver pauldrons and a translucent veil that behaves like water in zero‑G, one hand blessing, the other barring passage, expression tenderly vigilant (wonder with a hint of grief), skin dusted with gold-leaf cracks as if repaired; around their head a **broken crown** hovers in slow orbit—shards mid-collapse, each fragment reflecting a different childhood memory; the chapel’s time is measured by **eclipse bells**: dozens of bell-planets and crescent clappers hang from the dome, frozen mid-swing, casting razor-thin lunar shadows and prismatic halos across crowded pews that float like coffins, hymnals fluttering as moths, rosaries turning into vines, candle flames crystallized into tiny suns; a **Sphinx** is physically present as the altar itself—half-carved stone, half-breathing creature—its paws gripping the threshold steps, its eyes mirroring both sides of the door; a **cradle** hangs where a censer should be, overflowing with stardust, feathers, and a sleeping seed/egg that might hatch into a staircase; everywhere, micro-debris and sacred clutter fill the corners (keys, lockplates, cracked mirrors, toy soldiers, petrified petals, drifting sand that refuses to fall), with impossible architecture/nature fusion as the defining physics-break (stone becoming bark becoming reef becoming bone); subtle Easter egg: in an ornate side-niche **aquarium** worked into the choir stalls, a tiny captivity‑escape drama plays like a miniature opera—an imprisoned fish/figure inside a filigreed cage, a thread of bubbles mapping a secret tunnel, a tiny door ajar—visible only on close inspection; cinematic eclipse lighting, luminous pastel-gold color grade of childlike discovery, extreme texture detail, layered foreground/midground/background crowding, surreal paradox, frozen-action stillness, ultra-sharp, gallery-quality, no text, no logos.
