Vertical 2:3, centered **one-point perspective** from eye level inside an impossibly long Persian palace corridor that narrows to a single vanishing point; **the Shah** stands perfectly centered on a black-and-ivory tiled axis like a timeless idol mid-ritual—regal yet exhausted—heavy jeweled crown askew, embroidered robe half-slipped off one shoulder to reveal **classical, vulnerable nudity** (non-explicit), skin lit like marble under sickly lanternlight; his posture is still but charged, one hand hovering over a banquet tray of **empty silver dishes** that are somehow steaming, the other gripping a ceremonial scepter shaped like a gilded ribcage (desire as a throne made of need). The entire corridor is a **Lantern Festival** trapped in a single frozen instant: hundreds of silk lanterns at every depth plane, strings crossing the frame, paper tassels, incense smoke, confetti, ash, moth-scales, rice grains, and tiny floating teeth suspended in midair; lanterns glow ember-red and jaundice-gold, casting **creeping dread** shadows that stretch too far. The defining impossibility: **shadows have autonomy**—the Shah’s shadow is not aligned with him and instead kneels several meters ahead, mouth open in silent hunger, reaching backward with elongated fingers to steal light from nearby lanterns; other shadows detach from pillars and merchant stalls, bargaining with each other, strangling their owners’ feet, or climbing the walls like living calligraphy. Weave the **Death’s-head moth** as a dominant totem: an enormous moth with the skull-marking clearly visible, perched on the Shah’s collarbone like an omen, while smaller moths orbit lanterns in concentric rings; their wings shed dust that forms faint, temporary faces in the smoke. Introduce the **basilisk** as architecture and threat at once: a living basilisk coiled through an archway and along ceiling beams, its eyes mirrored in mosaic tiles; where its gaze falls, fruit bowls and goblets crystallize into salt, and a line of miniature stone courtiers (chess-piece scale) is mid-transformation, frozen between flesh and statue. Make **hunger/desire** infect the environment: carpets subtly ripple like tongues; doorways resemble parted lips; golden pomegranates split to reveal clockwork hearts; pearls drip from necklaces like saliva; a fountain runs not water but glimmering broth that never reaches the basin, hanging in suspended arcs. **Crowd every corner** with narrative clutter—overturned spice jars, scattered love letters with illegible script, broken mirrors reflecting scenes that don’t exist, a caged songbird made of shadow, hands reaching from behind curtains that are actually moth wings. Hide an Easter egg: in the rug border near the foreground, a **pumpkin morphs into a carriage wheel** motif (subtle, discoverable, not centered). Color grade: chiaroscuro with bruised teals and arterial reds, oppressive bloom around lanterns, fine dust in the air; ultra-intricate gallery illustration, sharp foreground texture, deep midground detail, readable depth lines, no empty space, no text, no watermark.
