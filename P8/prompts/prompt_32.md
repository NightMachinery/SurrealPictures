Portrait Dixit-card illustration, “Frozen Dream” frame: from a worm’s-eye view on mosaic floor tiles, the viewer looks up through a cathedral-like corridor of repeating arches and nested doorframes that multiply into several vanishing points (some receding upward, some sideways), as gravity is violently **displaced**—tables cling to walls, doorways open onto ceilings, guests hover in impossible orientations, and entire “rooms” drift like islands inside the hallway, all frozen mid-celebration. In the towering foreground, an ornate carved bronze-and-ivory ornament (filigreed lattice + dangling charms) dominates the bottom edge and partially occludes the scene, creating deep layers and occlusion. At the corridor’s paradoxical “center” stands the **Celebrant**: a mythic, timeless, androgynous figure with a serene ecstatic expression, head tilted as if listening to a chorus; their posture is regal yet vulnerable, one bare shoulder and torso rendered with classical, tasteful sensuality (chiaroscuro on skin like marble warmed from within), draped in a patchwork mantle made from many different people’s garments and ribbons, each stitched with tiny tokens (keys, rings, beads, family crests) implying a whole community carried on their body. They hold the **Derafsh Kaviani** as a monumental banner-pole that pierces multiple planes of the corridor at once; the legendary banner is jeweled and tattered-yet-glorious, embroidered with suns, lions, and starry rosettes, but its fabric is visibly composed of countless donated fragments—wedding veils, work aprons, prayer cloth, theater curtains—sewn into one impossibly radiant standard. Beneath and around them, a living **hearth fire** burns where it shouldn’t: a communal brazier suspended midair, its flames forming a warm heart-shaped vortex that licks upward without consuming anything, casting honey-gold light onto every face; floating embers drift like fireflies and become tiny lanterns in distant arches, visually “connecting” strangers across depth. The corridor is crowded edge-to-edge with intergenerational revelers, masked musicians, laughing elders, lovers, and solitary figures drawn into the same luminous orbit by threads of light and shared objects—hands almost-touching across gaps, plates of fruit and goblets frozen mid-toast, confetti, petals, and handwritten invitations suspended in the air like a constellation; every corner contains micro-stories (a child offering a crown to a weary soldier, a shy stranger holding an empty chair that floats toward an open circle, a chorus singing into a mirror that shows another crowd). Architecture reacts to **belonging**: bricks subtly morph into faces, banisters become clasped hands, doorframes sprout welcoming arms, and the corridor’s repeating perspective lines converge not to a point but to a glowing communal “we.” Atmosphere of transcendent **ecstasy**: prismatic aurora highlights, warm golds and ecstatic magentas with deep ultramarine shadows, radiant volumetric light beams, soft haze of incense, glittering dust, lens bloom, rich painterly detail (surrealist oil illustration realism, gallery-grade, hyper-detailed, intricate textures, no empty space). Hide a **dinglehopper (fork)** as an innocuous motif: its silhouette woven into a rug border pattern near the bottom corner or as a tiny trinket on a high shelf behind the foreground ornament—visible only on close inspection. Ultra high resolution, crisp focus with layered depth-of-field, dramatic foreshortening, no text, no watermark, no blank background, no minimalist composition.
