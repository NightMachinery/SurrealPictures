Bird’s-eye, isometric diorama view (tilt‑shift miniature realism) of a **kelp‑forest boulevard** turned into an underwater street‑canal: towering kelp fronds like cathedral columns, their ribbons forming shop awnings; **drifting market stalls** lashed together from coral, lacquered wood, rusted brass, and sea‑glass, crowded wall‑to‑wall with curios (bottled laughter, folded maps, caged fireflies that are actually plankton, jars of whispered names, tiny prisons made of pearl, clocks sold by the handful). In the exact center, frozen mid‑event, a mythic **Ferryman who is also the Prisoner**: an androgynous adult with classical, non‑explicit artistic nudity partly veiled by a heavy cloak stitched from ferry tickets and court documents; posture bowed yet defiant, one hand gripping an oar that doubles as a barred staff, the other hand chained to their own ankle—chains braided from kelp and rosary beads—so every attempt to row is also self‑dragging confinement. Their boat is a literal metaphor made impossible: a skiff shaped like a **stone cell** with an open door, floating as if weightless; the water around it is not water but **solidified sound**—visible concentric “echo” rings made of glassy ripples and duplicated objects, each resonance spawning smaller copies (a lantern echoed into a constellation of lanterns, a shackle echoed into a spiral of shackles), the entire boulevard reacting like a drumhead under a silent удар, action implied yet perfectly still (bubbles suspended like punctuation, fabric mid‑flutter, coins mid‑toss). A colossal **stopped clock** is embedded in the boulevard like a manhole/altar—hands pinned at an unreadable time, gears exposed—while a luminous **Jacob’s Ladder** rises and falls through the scene at an impossible angle, rungs made from vertebrae‑ivory and gilded reeds, vanishing into the clock face and reappearing among kelp crowns, suggesting ascent and recursion rather than escape. Populate every corner with tiny narrative clusters: a pair of old divers playing marbles with pearls that cast shadows shaped like memories; a merchant weighing “echoes” on a scale where the heavier pan is emptier; a small procession of mask‑wearers trading keys for breath; an eel braided through prayer flags; floating paper boats that are courtroom summonses; a chessboard where pieces are miniature ferrymen; scattered debris of love letters, locks, and broken compasses, all caught in the same frozen beat. Lighting and color grade: **childlike wonder**—bioluminescent teals, sea‑gold highlights, soft volumetric rays, rainbow caustics dancing across everything (yet frozen), hyper‑detailed painterly illustration with museum‑grade texture and micro‑stories at multiple scales, no empty horizons, frame densely packed foreground/midground/background. Hide a subtle homage: a **transparent spirit “No‑Face” mask** only as an Easter egg—an almost‑invisible trinket on a stall shelf, or a faint mask silhouette in the caustic light pattern on the cobblestones—never the focus. No text, no watermark, ultra‑high detail, paradoxical, emotionally intelligent ambiguity.
