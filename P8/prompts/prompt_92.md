Vertical Dixit-card illustration, gallery-quality surrealist oil-painting realism with baroque density and cinematic chiaroscuro: inside a **ritual archive** cramped to the edges—towering shelves of vellum ledgers, reliquary drawers, wax seals, bone-handled catalog keys, chanting diagrams, floating index cards, and soot-stained **whale‑oil lanterns**—a **mythic Giant** stands half-kneeling as if the room is too small for their centuries, backlit into a **black silhouette** whose edges glow ember-red; their colossal body is classical and vulnerable (tasteful nudity with a torn mantle of stitched library tags), posture heavy with tenderness, one hand cradling a feast platter like an offering, the other gripping a **spinning wheel** fused from brass, whale-bone, and astrolabe rings. The scene is a **Frozen Dream** mid-catastrophe of desire: **wine droplets, pomegranate seeds, torn lace, pearl beads, and paper ash hang motionless** in the air; warm lanternlight blooms like living blood through dust motes; vines of luminous flowers and ink-black roses erupt from cracks in the stone floor, wrapping columns and books in a pulse of **explosive vitality**. The impossible centerpiece is **Portal Displacement** made blatant: multiple oval portals, like wet mirrors cut into shelf-ends and book spines, misplace space—an endless **feast table** threads through them in impossible angles (table legs exiting a ceiling-portal, a silver tureen entering a drawer-portal, a roast bird hovering half-in/half-out of a catalog slot), while the Giant’s own silhouette contains a doorway where their ribcage should be, revealing a different room’s candlelit banquet happening “inside” their chest; silk threads from the spinning wheel spool outward and vanish into portals, reappearing as crimson ribbons tying lovers’ masks, binding scrolls, and lacing fruit like corsetry, suggesting **passion as an architecture** that rearranges reality. Crowd every corner with decipherable puzzles: kissing marble busts that bleed ink, a harp made of vertebrae, censored love letters pinned with thorns, mirrored pairs of gloves reaching for each other from separate shelves, a swarm of moths shaped like tiny hearts, spilled salt forming a map of a body, and a halo around the Giant made from suspended objects (keys, roses, figs, rings, censers, cracked hourglasses) all rim-lit. Hide the homage as a subtle reward: in the worn rug’s pattern near the bottom edge, a small **exiled heir** in a torn crown looks upward, and in the high skylight’s smoke-stain/constellation reflection a stern paternal face-eye (“sky‑vision”) watches—barely there, arguable, haunting. Color grade: incandescent ambers, carmine, verdigris shadows; ultra-detailed foreground/midground/background with no empty space; sharp focus with layered depth; **no text, no watermark, no blank background**, ambiguity-first, emotionally intelligent, paradox made tangible.
