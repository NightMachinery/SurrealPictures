Three-quarter cinematic angle (wide 24–28mm lens feel) inside a mirror-lined dressing hall that stretches into infinite reflections, dense with crowded wardrobes, vanity tables, costume racks, and hanging garments that “whisper” in visible breath-letters curling like ribboned subtitles (but no readable text); foreground cluttered with spilled pearl pins, kohl pencils, broken mirror shards, and a shallow puddle that reflects an impossible ceiling—because the **ceiling/sky has been replaced** by a vast open “firmament” made of floating wardrobe doors, drawers, and satin-lined compartments drifting like clouds, with constellation-stitching between them, as if the world’s heavens are an inside-out closet—everything frozen mid-event, dust and rain droplets suspended in the air as if time paused mid-inhale. In the midground stands **The Friend** as a mythic, intimate presence: an androgynous figure with calm, tired eyes and a tender half-smile, barefoot on cold tile, partially draped in a classical, translucent dressing gown and loose undone ties, posture protective and resilient—one hand bracing a cracked mirror wall as though holding reality together, the other gently cradling a **weathered skull** like a theatrical mask against their sternum, its fractures sewn with gold thread; from their shoulders emerge **Zahhak’s twin serpents** as living epaulets—scaled but soft-lit, affectionate rather than monstrous—coiling around their collarbones, nuzzling their neck, tongues tasting the whispered breath-letters from the wardrobes, their eyes reflecting compassion and hunger in the same glint. The hall reacts to their strength: mirror cracks knit themselves where their fingertips touch, bent wardrobe doors straighten slightly toward them, and floating garments orbit like protective satellites; tenderness saturates the lighting—warm rose-gold key light, candle-and-vanity-bulb glow, soft blue shadows, gentle bloom—yet the composition remains a crowded visual riddle in every corner: tiny hands inside drawers offering needles, a bouquet of gloves growing from a hatbox, a ribbon turning into a lifeline, a distant reflection showing the Friend simultaneously older/younger. **Hidden Easter egg**: on a low shelf or in the rug’s ornate pattern, a miniature **bus stop** under frozen rain where a small figure performs a rain-ritual with an umbrella while a faint translucent spirit stands just behind them, nearly missed among the clutter.
