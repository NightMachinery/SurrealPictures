Portrait 3:4, gallery-quality surrealist illustration — a cramped, labyrinthine **clock square where shadows are auctioned**: cobblestones inlaid with numerals, leaning clocktowers, pendulum streetlamps, kiosks shaped like hourglasses, velvet-draped auction dais stacked with ledgers, quills, price tags, and tiny gilded cages holding **other people’s shadows** like fluttering black silk; every surface dense with posters, charms, spilled ink, roses, gears, and floating receipts. Centered on a throne of winding keys and cracked marble cherubs sits **the Monarch**—mythic, tired-eyed, impossibly present—bare skin luminous under a half-fallen ceremonial mantle of **Simurgh feathers** (iridescent, calligraphic, woven into their regalia like a living tapestry), posture both commanding and exposed; their crown is a restrained **basilisk** coiled into diadem form, emerald gaze locked outward, its body doubling as jeweled filigree. The Monarch’s throat bears a **death’s-head moth** as a brooch that is also alive: wings half-open, powdery scales suspended mid-flutter, its skull-mark echoing in the bidding crowd’s faces and in the shadows for sale. **Weather containment is violently broken and unmistakable**: miniature seasons are trapped in transparent reliquaries being auctioned—hail rattling inside crystal maracas, a tornado corkscrewing in a perfume bottle, monsoon rain held in a glass globe—yet the contained storms leak into the plaza in a “Frozen Dream” instant: raindrops hover as pearls around mouths, lightning is a ribbon pinned in mid-snap, snowflakes burn like confetti, sunbeams drip like honey into puddles that reflect different times; umbrellas bloom indoors, clouds are folded like paper and stuffed into birdcages, and the air is thick with suspended motion. **Sensuality / passion** is the engine: heat-shimmer halos around bare shoulders, velvet-red petals emerging from cracks in stone and from the Monarch’s breath, bidders offering not money but kisses sealed in wax, hands reaching for shadows like lovers reaching for bodies; the environment blushes—warm coral and moonlit teal theatrical lighting, playful absurdity in every corner (a jester selling “midnight,” a violinist bowing a metronome, children swapping silhouettes like trading cards). Background teems with paradoxical vignettes: lovers’ shadows arguing without owners, clock hands tangled like limbs, cherubs tugging auction ropes tied to clouds. **Hidden Easter egg**: a small **ticking crocodile** appears only as a subtle motif—engraved on a pocketwatch on the auctioneer’s chain (or patterned into a rug near the throne), mouth slightly open as if counting seconds. Ultra-detailed, no empty space, crowded foreground/midground/background, painterly realism with symbolist surrealism, crisp micro-textures, cinematic depth, ambiguous narrative, emotionally intelligent whimsy, frozen mid-catastrophe.
