Gallery-quality surrealist illustration, “Frozen Dream” moment: inside a baroque courthouse that has become a greenhouse-cathedral, a mythic Widow stands at the center aisle—tall, exhausted, sovereign—her black veil stitched from courtroom transcripts, her gown a mourning dress that has germinated into translucent seedpods and tender roots (tasteful, classical nudity glimpsed through botanical lace), one hand steady, one trembling. She cradles a small glass reliquary/terrarium that **cannot contain** what it holds: an entire blooming metropolis and forest compressed inside it, yet the growth is escaping in impossible ways—orchids and vines pass through unbroken glass, rivers pour upward into jars without spilling, a miniature sun swells inside a bottle while its light floods the whole hall; containment fails everywhere (coffins used as planters bursting with fruit, legal cabinets leaking swarms of butterflies, pearls of water hovering midair like verdicts). The Scales of Justice hang from her wrist like living jewelry, wildly overloaded: one pan holds a beating heart wrapped in roots, the other holds a skull crowned with fresh shoots; the chains are tangled with ivy and newborn snakes. A many-headed Hydra coils through the architecture as a fountain-statue—each head frozen mid-breath, exhaling pollen and ink; some heads wear judge’s wigs, some are flowering, one is serene and blindfolded. Above, the Simurgh is physically present as a colossal stained-glass/feathered presence breaking from an alcove—wings spread, feathers transforming into pages, petals, and burning marigolds, scattering luminous debris across the frame. Atmosphere: explosive vitality—saffron, emerald, carmine; hard sunbeams + bioluminescent spores; chiaroscuro lit by impossible internal dawns. Crowd every corner: floating shards of mirror reflecting alternate outcomes, tiny witnesses (moths, seedlings, miniature statues) climbing columns, spilled scales-weights that are actually seeds, ink turning into vines, courtroom benches sprouting antlers and fruit, dust motes as tiny planets. Subtle hidden whisper: in a rug pattern / shelf trinket near the lower corner, a **marigold bridge** connects two tiny city models—one vivid living city, one ancestral metropolis in sepia stone—almost missable, a quiet passage between worlds. Hyper-detailed, Bosch-like density with Carrington/Varo dream-logic, art-nouveau filigree, cinematic composition, no empty space, no text, ambiguous narrative (is she nurturing the bloom or being judged by it?), razor-sharp, museum print.
