Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration, “frozen dream” mid-event: on a funerary avenue of black basalt tiles and ossuary arches, lined tightly with silent balconies packed with motionless onlookers—wax-masked mourners, stone saints, moth-winged judges, and empty clothing hanging like surrendered skins—everything paused at the peak of an impossible ritual cycle. Center frame stands the Mirror: a mythic, androgynous figure with a tall, fractured mirror for a face and a torso plated in tarnished reflective shards; their posture is stoic and forward-leaning, as if bracing against fate, one knee in a puddle of light, shoulders squared with determination. From their open ribcage (like a reliquary) a shared cup is being offered outward by two mirrored hands at once—one hand flesh, one hand glass—so the cup is simultaneously given and received; inside it, liquid flips states in layers (wine → mercury → sap → starlight) without mixing. A broken crown is present as both object and architecture: a split diadem clutched at their hip while its larger echo hangs above as a shattered halo-arch embedded into the avenue’s stonework, raining jeweled fragments that hover mid-fall. The defining impossibility is blatant material transmutation across the entire street: funeral wreaths calcify into brass serpents; marble angel statues are caught in the moment of turning into blooming muscle and then back into marble; ashes from censers become swarming butterflies made of iron filings; the basalt paving liquefies into luminous algae where footsteps should be, then refreezes into obsidian. Foreground is crowded with ritual debris—prayer ribbons, hourglass sand suspended like a constellation, cracked votive candles blooming into orchids, bone flutes exhaling colored smoke frozen in spirals—while midground procession figures repeat in a looping pattern (the same mourner appearing three times at different ages, arranged like a cyclical mandala), implying an endless rite. Lighting and color grade radiate explosive vitality against the funerary setting: electric vermilion and viridian bioluminescence licking the shadows, hard chiaroscuro highlights on glass and wet stone, a sunrise that feels earned rather than gentle. In the lower-left corner, half-obscured behind a chipped wall relief and a fallen banner, seven small pickaxes lean neatly against the masonry like a private joke for the attentive eye. Hyper-detailed, no empty horizons, every corner contains a clue, layered symbolism, paradoxical tenderness, cinematic wide-angle depth, crisp textures (glass, bone, velvet, oxidized metal), sharp focus with deep atmospheric haze, emotionally intelligent ambiguity—an image that feels like a vow being renewed at a funeral.
