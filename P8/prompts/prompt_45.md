Vertical 2:3 Dixit card illustration, centered one-point perspective inside a colossal stadium-temple corridor (marble + running track fused), ruthless converging depth lines pulling the eye to a hero dead-center: a mythic athlete mid-victory sprint yet perfectly frozen, chest lifted in ecstatic triumph, head tilted as if hearing their own name echo through centuries; their body is an anatomical impossibility—fragmented into discontinuous slices and impossible joints, each fragment repeating in a multiple-exposure trail (sequential beats of the same pose) while simultaneously dissolving into a living swarm (bees/starlings/black moths) that forms extra arms, a second ribcage, a third Achilles tendon hovering a handspan away, the swarm stitching and un-stitching them in midair. The “resonance/echo” is visible: concentric sound-rings emboss the air like glass, vibrating banners duplicate themselves down the hall, laurel leaves tremble in repeating afterimages, ripples propagate through stone pillars as if architecture were a drumskin; even dust motes and confetti hang in layered wavefronts, each particle casting two or three time-shadows. In the exact vanishing-point axis, a sword is sunk deep in a block of raw stone embedded in the track like an altar; the hero’s nearest hand (one of several) is about to grasp it, but another echo-hand already has, and another has let go—contradictory timelines stacked in one still. Above and behind the hero, integrated into the ceiling coffers, a luminous Faravahar (winged disk) is not merely a symbol but an engineered skylight: its wings are segmented into repeating feather-panels that mirror the athlete’s exposure-trails, casting radiant, celebratory gold and sapphire shafts that feel like an anthem made visible. Crowd the frame aggressively: foreground littered with trophies, cracked stopwatches, snapped starting pistols, floating ribbon curls, shattered mirrors reflecting alternate anatomies; midground packed with half-seen silhouettes in alcoves—judges with faceless masks, spectators holding empty crowns, twins in mirrored poses—watching the hero while looking away. Background tells a counter-narrative: a procession of kings at the corridor’s edges, each stepping around a waiting throne as if avoiding it, passing a crown hand-to-hand like a burden; their story is subtle, embedded again as an easter egg in a richly patterned rug along the track margin (a repeating cycle motif: crown → cradle → coffin → crown), and in a tiny mural frieze where the same monarch ages and resets in a loop. Triumphant color grade: victorious sunrise palette, gilded highlights, prismatic lens-bloom on the echo-rings, celebratory sparks frozen like stars; ultra-detailed surrealist gallery rendering (illustration, not photo), dense symbolism in every corner, no empty negative space, no text, no watermark.
