A meticulous “rationalist” clockmaker-librarian in round spectacles stands on a pearl staircase carved into a vast coral canyon, frantically stamping a final page in an impossibly long ledger as the canyon’s midnight clockface (etched into a cliff) ticks toward a deadline; with each tick, glamorous gold dust flakes off the stars and evaporates into the well’s mouth like vanishing makeup. Beside him, a grinning matchmaker—part fox, part tailor’s mannequin—pulls two luminous threads from its own ribs, offering them to two figures at the wishing well: one figure holds a cracked mirror that shows an uncomfortably honest face, the other clutches a delicate blindfold embroidered with constellations, hesitating between them. The wishing well is lined with softly sculpted statues (candle-wax people) slumped in tender poses, slowly melting into bouquets of paper flowers; a real bouquet droops in the foreground, petals browning, while one fresh enchanted rose in a glass bell jar still glows faintly, its stem forming a question mark. Mischief erupts in small, gleeful troublemakers—tiny ink-stained cherubs and shell-backed crabs—stealing commas from the ledger, swapping the two offered objects, and tugging at the matchmaker’s threads to knot fate into playful tangles. The background is richly layered: coral cathedrals with window-like holes, hanging lantern-jellyfish, shelves of drowned books embedded in stone, floating receipts and love letters caught on sea-fan branches, distant staircases looping upward into nowhere, and pearl steps reflecting ripples of moonlight; atmosphere dreamlike and softly unsettling, bioluminescent blues and warm golds, deep shadows, drifting glitter-sand, cinematic depth, intricate detail, vertical 2:3 composition.
