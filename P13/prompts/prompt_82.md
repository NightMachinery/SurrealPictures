Extreme low-angle view: on a puppet-opera avenue carved into monumental honey-colored stone, a weary Traveler stands at the foot of a towering ancestral metropolis, holding a small wrapped gift that glows faintly through torn paper like a living heartbeat. Above, a floral-chintz banner stitched with delicate bone buttons hangs between balconies; as it sways, it projects *memories* onto the street—faint scenes of the same avenue in different centuries—so the cobblestones shimmer with overlapping footprints that don’t match the bodies present. From an elevated balcony, half-hidden behind dangling love letters clipped to strings, unseen hands lower marionettes toward the crowd; the puppets’ strings vanish into fog, yet their shadows on the pavement are unmistakably human and taller than any person. A marigold bridge—made of countless blossoms and thin ribs like a ship’s frame—arches between the living city and its ghostly twin across the sky, and along the bridge drifts a vessel that seems rebuilt from mismatched planks and gilded carvings, each part subtly “wrong” as if replaced over time. Near the Traveler’s boots, a chameleon blends perfectly into a pile of fruit offerings, its eye reflecting the gift as though deciding whether to steal it or bless it. High overhead, a weathered winged emblem (half-bird, half-sun) is carved into the architecture, but its “wings” are actually open pages fluttering, shedding petals that turn to ash midair. The mood is playful yet unsettling—generosity poised on the edge of mischief—soft golden dusk light, long theatrical shadows, drifting incense and paper dust, richly layered alley details (posters, cracked mosaics, hanging lanterns, balcony railings, distant domes), dreamlike depth, vertical 2:3 composition.
