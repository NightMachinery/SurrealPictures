Over-the-shoulder view of a small robed acolyte with a half-burned candle cupped in both hands, stepping into a colossal banquet-nave where cathedral arches have grown into living cypress trunks and roots (an ancient “Cypress of Kashmar” echo), the air filled with a spiral of floating silverware and crystal goblets circling like a gentle storm; at the center, a radiant dancer—half human, half ornate construct of ivory joints, gilded gears, and porcelain skin—spins in blinding euphoria, her shadow dancing independently across the mosaic floor as if it has its own will; a ceremonial trident is held upright like a tuning fork to “conduct” the orbiting cutlery, while a flamingo-shaped croquet mallet rests against a pew of woven branches, its pink lacquer strangely pristine; the scene feels like a ritual feast without food—long tables set with empty plates that reflect impossible constellations, candles melting upward, wax forming tiny white birds that flutter and freeze midair; background packed with story details: stained-glass windows depicting innocent children with unreadable smiles, vine-wrapped columns carved with banquet guests who never arrive, scattered petals and salt lines marking the floor, hanging banners stitched from leaves and lace; soft yet unsettling dreamlight—warm gold from unseen chandeliers mixed with cool moonlit shafts through the glass—dust motes glittering, incense haze, faint embers drifting as if joy itself is burning, vertical 2:3 composition, whimsical surreal fairy-tale realism with rich layered textures and symbolic ambiguity.
