A serene greenhouse-parlor at midnight, perfectly symmetrical like a dollhouse cut down the middle: an elderly caretaker in embroidered slippers sits calmly in a velvet armchair before a small hearth, yet the hearth-fire is a quiet portal—its flames opening into another room where the same parlor is displaced by a few inches, as if reality slid sideways; the elder gently offers a wilting bouquet toward the fire as if returning it, while a smiling trickster (half-fox, half-cherub) perches on the mantel and secretly swaps the bouquet’s shadow with a living one that crawls away; above, the Faravahar appears not as an emblem but as a luminous moth-glyph hovering in the smoke, its wings made of tiny mirrored greenhouse panes; glowing golden hair—impossibly long—winds around the rafters like braided ropes, holding up the ceiling and tugging at objects with delicate tension (a teacup midair, a picture frame slightly misaligned, a curtain tied into a bow); along the tiled floor, neat rows of small yellow canisters labeled only by mute cork stoppers are stacked like library books, each subtly vibrating as if containing muffled screams, yet the room’s mood is contentment and perfect stillness—everyone behaves as though this is normal; bioluminescent vines lace the walls, spilling gentle cyan light onto layered details: cracked terracotta pots, moth-eaten Persian rugs, botanical sketches pinned to a harp-shaped screen, dust motes in shafts of moonlight, condensation on glass, distant rain tapping the greenhouse roof; soft, dreamlike lighting with warm fire-gold against cool moon-blue, faint haze, rich textures everywhere, magical realism, whimsical yet unsettling, frozen mid-action, no text, 2:3 vertical composition.
