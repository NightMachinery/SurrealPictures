Vertical 2:3 composition, bird’s-eye “diorama” view of a surreal sea-cave courtroom carved into a cliff: phosphorescent waves roll in slow motion beneath translucent lapis-lazuli Persian tilework, every arch and stair inlaid with tiny mythic reliefs and a weathered Faravahar motif half-submerged in salt. At the center, an anxious explorer in travel-worn finery (glamour visibly evaporating into glitter-dust as a midnight hourglass runs out) stands on steps made of “solid liquidity” — a frozen pour of seawater behaving like polished glass — presenting a wilting bouquet to the court as if it were evidence. A silent guardian—part statue, part living judge—leans forward from a throne of coral and blue ceramic, its shadow forming wings across the tiles like an omen of taboo. The explorer’s forearm bears a small white rabbit tattoo that seems to look back at the viewer; the rabbit’s eye is a tiny keyhole. A music box sits open on a floating sandbar, its mechanism turning without hands, casting delicate, impossible notes as ribbon-like currents; the melody visibly coils through the air, binding miniature narrative clusters around the chamber: a forbidden door sealed with wax and hair; a bottled thunderstorm held in a lantern (weather containment) with lightning trapped like thread; tiny witnesses—masked seabirds, porcelain divers, and clockwork fish—arranged as if in testimony; a discarded invitation card dissolving at the edges into sea-foam. The whole scene feels like a frozen moment right before a verdict, playful yet unsettling, layered with story details and hidden symbols, dreamlike lighting from bioluminescent surf and moon-silver shafts, soft painterly textures, surreal magical realism, rich background everywhere.
