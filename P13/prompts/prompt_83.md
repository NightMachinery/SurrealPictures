A vast sunken throne room turned community workshop: a coral-encrusted throne lies toppled like a broken stage, while tidal chandeliers—huge glassy jellyfish-lanterns—rise and fall on invisible currents, casting moving lattices of light across mosaicked floors. At the center, two sisters hover ankle-deep in water that behaves like solid crystal where it touches their skin—one sister stands on a perfectly rigid, stair-stepped “sheet” of water, elevated and isolated, her gaze threaded to a hovering all-seeing eye formed from a porthole window and writhing clockwork irises; the other sister is down among the people, hands busy, trying to pull the crystal-water apart like taffy to make a bridge back to her. Around them, a ring of divers, masked musicians, and barnacle-flecked neighbors work together in quiet rebellion: they dismantle a drowned technological terror—an iron leviathan surveillance engine half-buried in silt—turning its gears into instruments and tools. A gentle mentor figure in a patched captain’s coat guides the crowd, holding an open music box like a holy relic; its tiny ballerina is missing, replaced by a miniature ship-in-a-bottle that spins and projects shimmering notes as visible ribbons, and those ribbons stitch the fractured room into warmth and belonging. The elevated sister’s face shows intoxicating ecstasy and fear—transcendent bliss at her isolating power—while the lower sister’s expression mixes love, grief, and stubborn defiance. In the background: collapsed archways reveal a flooded city beyond, with drifting banners, upside-down gardens of seaweed, and distant silhouettes watching from balconies; small details everywhere—crabs carrying keys, paper letters sealed in wax floating like petals, mirrors cracked into fish-shaped shards. Atmosphere dreamlike and softly unsettling, with bioluminescent dust, slow bubbles, and moonlight filtering down in cathedral beams, as if the entire scene is a suspended moment right before the sisters either reunite or the eye closes forever.
