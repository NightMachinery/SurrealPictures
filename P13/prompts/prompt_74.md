Vertical 2:3 illustration, extreme low-angle close portrait from the cobblestones of a narrow bridge-bazaar suspended between two colossal bell towers: a young alchemist in weathered leather and brass clasps strides forward fearlessly, coat flaring like a banner, amber lanterns and vials clinking at their belt; in their arms a rumpled living “sorting” hat yawns open like a velvet throat, trying to swallow (or rescue) a shower of tiny star-children falling gently from the sky, each trailing glittering threads that snag on clotheslines and prayer flags. Behind them, monumental architecture looms—an immense clock face embedded in a tower is stopped at an impossible hour, its hands fused with frost, while silent bells hang above like planets. Market stalls crowd the bridge: cages of bottled dawn, jars of captured laughter, maps that crawl like insects, a vendor golem made of stitched parchment and river stones offering warm bread on a platter with a grateful bow; a radiant holy-grail-shaped cup sits inside a clear containment reliquary, sealed in honeyed amber, tempting and ominous. Layered background details: lantern-lit awnings, ropes and pulleys, chimneys exhaling blue smoke, mosaics of faded saints replaced by constellations, spilled spices forming tiny galaxies on the planks, distant rooftops drowning in mist. Soft golden-and-cool teal twilight, dust motes and star-sparks in the air, dreamlike depth, playful yet unsettling tension—are the falling stars being saved, sorted, or collected as time refuses to move.
