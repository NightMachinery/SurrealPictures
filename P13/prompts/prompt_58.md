Vertical 2:3 Dixit-style surreal fairy-tale scene: in the extreme foreground, two oversized human hands emerge from a torn velvet curtain of moss—one hand gently offering a wilting bouquet whose petals drip into tiny glass fish, the other hand cradling a warm, imperfect “philosopher’s stone” that glows like an ember and quietly stitches cracks in the skin with threads of light; the composition is intentionally left-heavy, crowded with micro-details (miniature doorways in bark, pocket watches growing on vines, small paper boats sailing through puddles in the palm lines, insects carrying stained-glass shards like stained relics). Midground: a great white wolf with fur like fresh snow stands on a stair of roots and carved marble, calm and protective, its breath forming faint glyphs; a single giant eyeball (moon-sized yet intimate) is suspended above the wolf on a chain of ivy, slowly turning to follow something unseen. Background: an ancient temple where architecture and nature fuse—columns are living trees, arches are ribcages of stone overgrown with ferns—inside, rotating stained-glass altars spin like slow carousel wheels, projecting shifting colored halos across wet floors and broken statues; one fallen statue is missing its face, replaced by a nest of flowers that are both blooming and browning. In the far distance, a small cloaked figure limps toward the temple door, leaving behind footprints that briefly blossom, then fade, suggesting healing and recovery with a touch of playful absurdity. Atmosphere: soft dusk light filtered through stained glass and mist, floating dust motes like tiny planets, gentle shadows that feel slightly unsettling, dreamlike depth, richly textured environment, cinematic stillness as if caught mid-spell.
