A faceless escapee in a floating, ornate aquarium-lantern has just unlatched its gilded door from the inside; water pours out in a slow, impossible tidal wave that hangs in the air like a translucent curtain, carrying tiny furniture, keys, and handwritten memories past the viewer. Outside the glass, a cathedral-fortress of coral and brass rises from a midnight shoreline—pipe-organs made of seashells, staircases woven from kelp, stained-glass windows filled with drifting plankton-light—while its walls subtly fracture into glowing gridlines and falling ribbons of code, as if the world is a simulated set collapsing. An enormous tiger stands calmly on a narrow brass bridge, offering its paw through the suspended water; around its wrist is a bright friendship bracelet tied in a childlike knot, and its striped fur maps into anatomical impossibilities—transparent ribs showing a small, steady eternal flame burning where a heart should be. The escapee reaches toward the tiger, not quite touching, fingers dissolving into schools of fish before reforming, the moment balanced between serenity and liberation. Deep calm, playful yet unsettling wonder; layered, story-rich background packed with coral relics, brass mechanisms, scattered talismans, and distant figures watching from balconies with blank masks. Soft bioluminescent lighting, moonlit mist, prismatic reflections in the suspended water, dramatic depth, painterly surreal magical realism, high detail, vertical 2:3 composition.
