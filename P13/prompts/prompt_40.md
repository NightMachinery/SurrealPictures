Vertical 2:3 — Extreme low-angle view of a solitary “architect” traveler standing at the base of colossal, half-finished monument-arches carved from black volcanic glass; they lift a cracked, broken crown above their head as if deciding whether to mend it or let it fall. A tidal wave hangs overhead, impossibly paused mid-crash—its water has turned into “solid liquidity,” a translucent stone-syrup curling in slow motion, threaded with tiny glowing thank-you notes, petals, and offerings suspended inside like gratitude made visible. The ground is a vast obsidian-mirror plateau reflecting everything with unsettling clarity; in the reflections, the traveler’s face splits into two expressions—one serene with blissful ignorance, one raw with painful truth—like alternate selves arguing silently. In the mirrored distance, an entirely different scene flickers: a savanna usurpation—shadowy animals circling a firelit confrontation—burns on the horizon as if it’s happening somewhere else, or in another time. The traveler’s hand holds a compass that suddenly blossoms into a small blueprint-bird (a eureka moment taking flight), tugging toward a faraway doorway in the monumental structure, radiating aching longing and distance. Ash drifts like snow; heat-haze ripples through the air; warm firelight from below collides with cold moonlight from above, casting elongated, dreamlike shadows and filling the layered background with carved reliefs, scaffolds, distant ruins, and intricate architectural details that hint at a fairy tale mid-decision.
