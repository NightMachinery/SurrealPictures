A candle-warm lantern festival drifts past the stained windows of a drowned cathedral-archive: hundreds of paper lanterns float like slow jellyfish above waist-deep water between towering shelves of salt-stained folios, copper piping, and patina-green mechanical card catalogs. In the center aisle, a masked archivist “Parent” stands ankle-deep on a floating reading desk, calmly stamping blank pages as if recording dreams; their mask is cracked porcelain, and behind it another mask peeks through, slightly misaligned. Across the flooded aisle—too far to reach—a child watches with aching longing, clutching a small riddle box that has unfolded into a tiled logic game: domino-like stones, chess pieces, and lettered runes arranged in a spiral; each move subtly rewrites the architecture, bending shelves into impossible angles and turning ladders into bridges that lead nowhere. Between them, a Pied Piper figure made of soft sculpture—stitched velvet skin, seams visible, stuffed cloth hair—plays a silver flute; the notes are visible as thin ribbons of light that tug the lanterns into a procession, guiding them to form a glowing arrow that points simultaneously toward the child and away into deeper stacks. From the water rises a wooden hand with joint pins (lifelike, but unmistakably carved), reaching up to hold the flute as if puppeteering the melody; its other fingers delicately slide a single logic tile, causing the child’s reflection to appear on the Parent’s mask while the Parent’s shadow falls behind the child. Background packed with story: whale-oil lanterns in iron cages swaying from rafters, wax drips on brass, tiny labels on jars of “forgotten names,” paper boats carrying catalog cards, copper keys hanging like wind chimes, distant figures in festival masks rowing silently between aisles. Dreamlike, playful yet unsettling, rich textures and layered details, warm amber lantern light against cool moonlit blues, mist and floating dust motes, deep perspective, vertical 2:3 composition.
