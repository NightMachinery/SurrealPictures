A faceless, robed guardian stands at the threshold of a vast moonlit greenhouse-cathedral where desert sand has drifted into the aisles; in its gloved hands, it offers an impossibly heavy gift box whose lid has sprung open, spilling a warm torrent of handwritten thank-you notes that swirl like migrating birds and settle onto leaves, statues, and sleeping faces. Before the guardian, a lone traveler hesitates mid-step between two tall doors grown from living wood: one door is carved with a serene smiling mask and exudes a narcotic fog of forgetfulness, the other is carved with a weeping mask and leaks sharp, crystalline light like painful truth; the traveler’s shadow splits in two and reaches toward both choices. An immense hourglass hangs overhead where the “sand” is tiny glowing embers; each ember falls into a shallow basin and blooms into a small burning bush that never consumes itself, turning the nave into a constellation of firelit shrubs. Leaning against a cracked marble altar is a pristine white guitar with no strings; when the embers fall, invisible chords seem to ripple through the air, bending the thank-you notes into musical staff lines. In the background, a pale pegasus is tethered by a ribbon of starlight to a wrought-iron balcony, calmly drinking from the hourglass basin as if it were water, its wings shedding soft feathers that become paper boats floating through the greenhouse’s misty canals. The environment is dense and story-rich: mossy stained-glass windows depicting blank faces, shelves of seed packets labeled with forgotten names, hanging lanterns filled with fireflies, potted vines climbing up broken columns, tiny offerings left on steps (coins, bread, keys, small crowns), and distant silhouettes of onlookers behind fogged panes. Dreamlike magical realism, whimsical yet unsettling, deep perspective, intricate textures everywhere, soft twilight with ember-glow highlights and long shadows, 2:3 vertical composition.
