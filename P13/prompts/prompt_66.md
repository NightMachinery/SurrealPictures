Portrait 2:3 — In an endless gallery that feels like a paper-collage palace of stacked decorative planes, a quiet hooded hermit stands at a brass control console whose jeweled buttons are labeled with tiny pictograms (sun, thunder, perfume, teeth, lullaby); he presses one with a gloved finger while, around him, dozens of ornate doors hang in midair, each opening into a different weather system spilling into the hall (a rainstorm pours upward, a snow-blizzard crawls along the floor like fog, a small cyclone trapped in a lantern, warm desert wind scattering petals). In the center, a large Dharma wheel rotates slowly like a clockwork mandala, and from its spokes trail marionette strings that tug gently at three figures in a tense, intimate tableau: two half-embracing travelers being pulled toward different doors, and a sorrowful three-headed hound (Cerberus) revealed as a puppet—one head snarling, one head whispering, one head sleeping—its paws hovering just above the tiles as if displaced from reality. Tiny kodama tree-spirits peek from cracks in the woodwork and from knots in the doorframes, watching with childlike wonder, leaving thumbprint-sized leaves wherever they touch; their wide eyes mirror the stormlight. The hall’s background is dense with story details—frayed tapestries that depict impossible maps, cupboards of bottled sunsets, drifting keyrings, footprints that lead onto walls, floating dust motes shaped like miniature doors—while soft, unsettling twilight glows from every doorway, casting layered shadows that don’t match their owners and a tender, charged atmosphere of longing, control, and discovery.
