A stoic librarian-hero stands centered on a volcanic plateau paved with cracked obsidian mirrors, raising a battered catalog stamp like a scepter in a quiet moment of victory; their outfit is a meticulous half-costume—one side humble patched linen, the other side ornate royal brocade—suggesting an identity being performed mid-scene. From the viewer’s behind-the-curtain vantage, translucent velvet-and-ash textiles billow across the foreground like stage drapes, partially veiling the hero and refracting the world into gentle fragmentation (prismatic splits, doubled reflections, torn-page motes). In the background a lavish tea party unfolds with escalating, absurd etiquette: guests (commoners in borrowed crowns, nobles wearing plain work gloves) measure teacup distances with rulers, bow to empty chairs, and pass a single spoon along an impossibly long table that spirals into the landscape like a paper ribbon; every action is precise, ceremonial, and faintly unsettling. Farther back, the architecture/nature fusion becomes clear—library towers grown from living trees, staircases turning into roots, balconies blooming into shelves of mossy books—while a colossal tidal wave hangs frozen mid-crash behind the buildings as if held by an unseen rule, its surface filled with floating letters, teacups, and tiny mirrored shards. Near the hero’s feet sits an open athanor-like furnace made of brass and stone, quietly glowing; inside it, pages smolder without burning, releasing luminous ink-smoke that forms fleeting heraldic crests and then dissolves. Atmospheric, dreamlike lighting: soft dawn mixed with ember-red underglow from the furnace, mist rolling over mirror-stone, delicate caustics from the suspended wave, deep layered background packed with story clues; whimsical surreal magical realism, painterly detail, slightly playful yet ominous, vertical 2:3 composition.
