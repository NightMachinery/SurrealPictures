A lone hermit-operator in weatherworn robes and bright sugar-skull face paint stands on a narrow catwalk inside a colossal ice refinery that feels like a cathedral, laughing in quiet triumph as he reels in the string of a small flying kite that should not be indoors; behind him, concentric circular frames—like nested portholes, halos, and instrument dials—align perfectly around his body, turning him into the still center of a ritual. The hailstorm outside hammers the refinery’s stained-glass safety wards, and each impact blooms into prismatic warning sigils across the windows; shards of ice hover midair as if time has stuttered. From a frosted vat rises the Simurgh, enormous yet delicate, assembled from origami pages and etched metal feathers, its wings partly mechanical—hinges, filigreed gears, and sap-like tubes—shedding paper scraps that fold themselves into tiny birds. Along the floor, “mechanical nature” creeps through the architecture: brass vines, piston-flowers, and mossy cogs slowly grinding down into rusted powder, an elegant entropy spreading like autumn. In the far background, the refinery wall is visibly crumbling like plaster, peeling back the illusion of the world to reveal a luminous layer of falling code and gridlines beneath, as if reality itself is a staged set coming apart. Foreground details: frost-laced handrails, spools of silver thread, scattered paper constellations, melting wax seals with warding symbols, a pocket lantern casting warm light into the cold blue haze. Cinematic, dreamlike, playful yet unsettling; soft volumetric light, glittering ice dust, deep layered environment, vertical 2:3 composition, a frozen moment that hints at a secret victory and an imminent unraveling.
