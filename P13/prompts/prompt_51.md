A masked procession of small blue-furred figures with purple spots dances in blinding euphoria around a towering maypole on a monolithic basalt coast; the maypole is a “stopped clock” made literal—its frozen hands and numerals form the ribbons, stretched taut as if time itself is braided, while a colossal lapis-lazuli vessel at the center tilts and “pours” not water but shimmering Persian tilework that unfurls into the ground like a living mosaic carpet. Above, a perpetual aurora hangs low and silky, shedding falling green digital rain that hisses into the tiles, turning some patterns into glowing runes and others into realistic ivy, so the shoreline flickers between ancient palace and glitched dream. One dancer lifts their mask slightly: behind it is another mask, then another—an illusion nested inside an illusion—yet their shadow on the mosaic shows a calm, solitary lighthouse keeper holding the same vessel, a quiet contradiction. In the distance: basalt monoliths like organ pipes, tide pools reflecting upside-down constellations, tile-framed archways half-buried in sand, paper lanterns snagged on black rocks, and a horizon where the aurora seems to be stitched to the sea. Soft, unsettling wonder; luminous lapis highlights, emerald rain streaks, salty mist, intricate background storytelling everywhere, cinematic depth, 2:3 composition.
