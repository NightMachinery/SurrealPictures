A masked healer with delicate sugar-skull face paint kneels on a slanted moonlit rooftop, mending a torn strip of the night itself—a vast tapestry of constellations—using a thorn as needle and a thread that glows like seawater; a half-burned candle in their hand drips wax that falls upward, hardening into tiny stair-steps for a childlike figure attempting a “second-star” flight above the chimneys, while the healer watches with earned, quiet pride and uneasy wonder. The rooftops around them are edible architecture—gingerbread gables, marzipan gargoyles, licorice gutters—gnawed at the edges by wind, yet overgrown with impossible flora/fauna fusions: ivy that ends in feathered fins, pigeons whose wings sprout petals, and lanternfish swimming through the air as if it were water. At the far end of the roofline, a calm bear stands like a solemn guardian at a makeshift court, wearing a crown woven from lotus leaves and broken porcelain, presiding over tiny rooftop “citizens” (paper-thin silhouettes) who hold courtly poses; behind them, the city folds seamlessly into a sea-cave amphitheater where phosphorescent waves roll through arched doorways, casting rippling blue light across thorny curtains and embroidered skycloth banners. In a puddle on the roof, a single lotus opens, reflecting not the moon but an unfamiliar constellation, as if the repaired sky is already changing; atmosphere of soft mist, drifting sugar dust, bioluminescent spray, and distant bells, dreamlike, playful yet unsettling, rich layered background, portrait orientation 2:3.
