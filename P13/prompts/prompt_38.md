Portrait 2:3 — A weary “rationalist” mapmaker in rolled-up sleeves stands ankle-deep in a steaming, labyrinthine bathhouse, stamping contracts onto drifting paper boats while translucent spirits haul towels and brass pipes like indentured dockworkers; a massive beanstalk has burst through the tiled floor and been “domesticated” into the building’s plumbing, its vines braided with staircases and archways so that architecture and living wood are inseparable. Behind him rises a wide panoramic vertical stack of spatial layers like a cutaway tower: at the lowest level, mushroom catacombs glow with ember spores, lighting frescoes of a Tree of Life that climb the damp walls; mid-level corridors loop into impossible knots with doorways opening onto childhood bedrooms, empty train platforms, and old family kitchens—warm, sad nostalgia seeping from each threshold; higher up, bathhouse balconies turn into hanging gardens and root-bridges where birds nest in teacups and lanterns bloom like fruit. The central action: the mapmaker pauses, pen hovering, confronted by two adjacent bathhouse doors—one door made of clear mirror-glass showing a painful truth (his own reflection aging rapidly, ink turning to blood on the map), the other door veiled in milky steam promising blissful ignorance (soft silhouettes dancing, lullaby light). Above the doors hangs the Derafsh Kaviani as a living banner woven from leaves, coins, and old cloth, gently tugging toward the truth-door like a conscience in the wind. Dense detail everywhere: wet tiles patterned with tiny maze diagrams, soap bubbles containing miniature rooms, contract seals shaped like moths, moss growing in the grout, distant footsteps echoing from corridors that fold back into themselves; soft, dreamlike lighting with ember-spore glow from below, moonlit steam from above, and a faint unsettling hush as if the whole building is holding its breath.
