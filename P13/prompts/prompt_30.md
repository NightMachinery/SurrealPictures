A moonlit kitchen courtyard in an ancestral metropolis, tiled with cracked blue-and-white ceramics and overgrown with fruit trees whose roots braid through the grout and climb the walls like living filigree; a marigold bridge arches overhead, made of thousands of blossoms woven into a luminous walkway connecting the courtyard to distant rooftops where ghostly windows glow. In the courtyard’s center, a healer in a plain apron and crownless posture performs a ritual at an open doorway standing alone with no building attached—an ornate doorframe propped upright by a delicate brass apparatus of pulleys, mirrors, and measuring arms; the healer’s face is partly hidden behind this symbolic machine as if being evaluated or translated. Gravity has subtly reversed: fallen oranges and pomegranates hover like planets, a kettle pours upward in a silent stream, loose recipe pages drift toward the marigold bridge, and a white swan glides through the air as if swimming in invisible water, its wings folded, leaving ripples of faint light. A masquerade mask lies on the threshold like a discarded identity, but its inner lining is on the outside—stitched seams exposed, the “face” turned inward—while the healer gently holds a half-burned candle whose flame burns downward, illuminating the underside of things and casting inverted shadows onto the sky. At the doorway, a single figure steps through mid-motion, split by the frame: on one side dressed as a commoner with flour-dusted hands, on the other side wearing royal fabrics and jeweled sleeves; their posture suggests ecstatic, transcendent bliss and fear at once, as if the act of choosing reshapes them. Background packed with story details: distant balconies hung with laundry that looks like ceremonial banners, ancestral portraits peering from lit windows, marigold petals drifting like slow snow, fruit blossoms sprouting from teacups, faint silhouettes watching from rooftops; soft, dreamlike haze, warm candle-gold against cool lunar blues, painterly texture, whimsical yet unsettling, surreal fairy-tale realism, high detail, 2:3 composition.
