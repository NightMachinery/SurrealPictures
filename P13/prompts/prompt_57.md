A 2:3 vertical illustration of a nocturnal woodland carnival boulevard where tall mirrored kiosks line a leaf-strewn path; their reflections don’t match reality, instead showing tiny domestic rooms carved into tree trunks—miniature kitchens, laundry lines, and jewel-mine tunnels where luminous gemstones are scrubbed like dishes. In the center, a long feast table floats upside-down above the path (gravity reversed), its hanging tablecloth billowing like a parachute; cups and cutlery drift upward like curious insects. A calm, masked therapist in a traveling coat sits on a low stool beneath the hovering table, holding a clipboard and offering a hand mirror to a gleeful troublemaking child who is secretly “whistling” the scene into motion—each whistle causes reflections to swap places with real objects. A dragon with a shaggy green mane crouches beside the therapist like an anxious pet, trying to lick a single golden egg balanced on the therapist’s knee; the egg glows with taboo importance, casting warm light that the child keeps trying to steal. Above them, a death’s-head moth the size of a hat drifts through lantern smoke, its wings patterned like a warning mask; wherever it passes, the mirrored kiosks briefly reveal forbidden moments (hands reaching, doors half-open, a feast that becomes a mine). The forest canopy is dense with paper lanterns, pinned tickets, and dangling keys; distant figures in carnival costumes wander between kiosks, half-reflected, half-real. Atmosphere: dreamy and soft yet unsettling, moonlit fog mixed with carnival lamplight, subtle sparkles of gemstone dust in the air, deep layered background detail, storybook surrealism with playful menace.
