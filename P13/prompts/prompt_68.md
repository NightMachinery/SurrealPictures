Vertical 2:3 — Inside a lighthouse’s circular sunroom, a blue‑haired girl in a yellow raincoat stands close with her unseen “friend” (only suggested by a second pair of boots, a warm shadow, and a handprint on fogged glass), both leaning over a wilting bouquet as if sharing a secret vow; an owl in a lighthouse-keeper’s waistcoat perches on a brass astrolabe, calmly unlatching a glass globe that contains a miniature thunderstorm, and the released rain falls upward into silk-draped rafters where trapped rainbows hang like captive ribbons; on the tiled floor, a tiny portal has displaced the room—an oval of moonlit sea opens between rugs, sending slow waves across scattered postcards and nautical charts, while a distant coastal town appears inside the portal as if it’s a memory you could step into; a cricket with a top hat and a lace umbrella conducts the drifting droplets like an orchestra, triumphant and ridiculous; through the tall windows the sky shows an eclipse mid-bloom, its dark ring casting soft, unsettling twilight that makes every color feel intimate and forbidden; fill the background with layered curios (shell-lamps, mossy potted vines, salt-stained books, lighthouse gears, hanging prisms, wet footprints that don’t match any present body), creating a frozen fairy-tale moment of quiet closeness, contained weather, sensual tension, and ambiguous victory.
