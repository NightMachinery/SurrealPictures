A tall 2:3 vertical scene composed like a stacked fairytale cross‑section of a city: at the lowest layer, an ancient stone vault glows with an unending altar-flame, its heat making coins, petals, and small masks hover; above it, a bustling midnight festival fills a terraced plaza tiled in intricate turtle‑shell mosaics, where a fox in a patched cartographer’s coat stands on a levitating banquet table, raising a compass whose needle points not north but upward; as the fox turns the compass, a giant death’s‑head moth unfurls from a ribboned lantern and beats its wings, and the plaza’s bunting transforms into drifting map‑fragments—coastlines, constellations, and street grids—spooling into the clouds; at the highest layer, those cloud‑maps tear open like paper to reveal star‑children gently falling like confetti, some laughing, some solemn, their tiny hands clutching miniature compass roses; in the center, a phoenix made of ember‑feathers and festival sparklers rises from the eternal flame below, trailing glowing ash that becomes fireworks midair, while the crowd cheers in silence, mouths open but no sound—only the soft rustle of maps and wings; rich background details everywhere: balconies stacked with potted night-blooms, weathered signs in unknown alphabets, streamers tangled in chimneys, distant floating rooftops, and a horizon of layered terraces fading into mist; dreamy, playful yet unsettling mood, luminous warm flame against cool moonlit blues, cinematic atmospheric haze, high fidelity, densely textured, magical realism, surreal narrative moment.
