Portrait 2:3 — Inside a funhouse cathedral where the nave is built from warped mirrors and bent stained-glass panels, a lone dancer in delicate sugar-skull makeup pauses mid-spin, one foot hovering above a mosaic floor that seems to rotate in a slow circular choreography around a single unmoving symbol: a tarnished trident embedded upright in the stone like a relic; at its base, the very first blossom has just split the marble, petals catching the light as if announcing a quiet eureka. An octopus, impossibly intimate and gentle, is wrapped around the dancer’s waist like a silk sash—its tentacles guiding the spin—while two of its arms reach into different mirrors at once, pulling out mismatched objects (a rosary, a key, a ribbon of sheet music) that shouldn’t fit through glass. Overhead, gilded cages hang like chandeliers, some empty, some holding tiny cathedral spires, some holding ordinary household birds that look enormous in reflection (scale inversion through the mirrors); one cage contains a stopped clock the size of a window, its hands frozen at an unreadable time, reflected endlessly so it becomes a halo behind the dancer’s head. The background is richly layered: confessionals turned into dressing rooms, rippling velvet curtains, cracked gold leaf, candlewax drips suspended midair, choir stalls filled with abandoned masks, and mirror corridors that bend into impossible chapels within chapels. Dreamlike lighting: cool moonlight fractured through stained glass, warm candleglow pooling on the rotating mosaic, prismatic reflections multiplying the dancer and octopus into tender near-touches—playful yet softly unsettling, like a fairy tale caught in the instant before a secret is spoken.
