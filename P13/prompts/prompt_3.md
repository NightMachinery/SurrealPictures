Vertical 2:3 — Extreme low-angle portrait from ground level: a serene masked gardener-vizier stands perfectly still in the immediate foreground, hands folded around a smooth human skull that doubles as a seed pod (eye sockets sprouting tiny mossy ladders), expression unreadable yet content; his long robes appear carved from pale stone but flow like liquid, pooling into reflective water at his feet. Behind him, a monumental tower-palace dominates the left side of the frame, its architecture impossibly ornate—arched ribs, staircases that loop back into themselves, balconies like birdcages—yet parts of it soften and drip downward as if gravity is optional. From a high window, a living “Jacob’s ladder” unfurls: braided vines, ribbons, and bone-white steps climbing into the clouds, each rung lit by small, breathing lanterns. The background plaza is a masked masquerade in kinetic chaos: dancers whirl in a circular ritual around a fountain that pours sand upward; living chandeliers float overhead like jellyfish, their crystal droplets turning into moths and falling as glowing confetti; paper masks tumble on the wind and briefly become faces on passing strangers. A great white wolf (fur luminous, eyes clever) slips through the crowd on the right, wearing an outlaw’s half-cape and carrying a stolen key between its teeth, looking back toward the still figure as if inviting him to escape the tower’s spell. Dense, left-heavy composition (tower + ritual crowd), counterbalanced by micro-details on the right: tiny gardeners pruning stars from hedges, beetles hauling miniature mirrors, a pocket watch cracked open to release a flock of clockwork birds. Soft moonlight mixes with warm chandelier-glow, creating a dreamy, unsettling calm—foreground silence against a background storm of celebration.
