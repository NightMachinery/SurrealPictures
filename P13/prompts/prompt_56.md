A clandestine trial unfolds in a sunken amphitheater carved into the rim of a sleeping volcano: a lone traveler stands at a cracked bus-stop shelter repurposed as the witness stand, hands clasped around a broken crown they’re trying to mend, while every denial makes their nose lengthen into a splintered wooden branch that suddenly bears fresh lightning scars and tiny budding leaves; with each new lie the branch snakes outward, rooting into the basalt steps until it becomes a real tree growing through the courtroom, its blackened trunk splitting the aisle of molten-glass tiles. Around them, ceremonial tapestries hang like heavy curtains from impossible heights, embroidered with shifting scenes that seem to whisper verdicts; the “jury” is a ring of toys—tin soldiers, porcelain dolls, stuffed animals—quietly transmuting mid-sentence into solemn adults and back again, their seams unzipping to spill paper testimonies that flutter as origami birds. Outside the shelter, a rain ritual is in progress: umbrellas are held upside down to catch warm, ash-speckled rain, and in each puddle a pale spirit face briefly surfaces to listen; above, the Simurgh appears as a vast, half-transparent bird made of drifting court summons and feathers of ember, circling slowly as if deciding whether to intervene. A gentle figure in threadbare robes steps forward and cups the traveler’s hands—an unmistakable healing warmth spreads like sunrise through the broken crown, knitting it together with glowing gold sap that also softens the harsh growth of the wooden nose-branch, even as distant thunder rolls and the volcano’s inner light pulses under the stone seats, casting long, unsettling shadows through banners, ruins, and watching masks. Vertical composition, rich layered background packed with story clues, dreamlike magical realism, whimsical yet uncanny.
