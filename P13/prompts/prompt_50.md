Vertical 2:3 — A blue‑haired girl in a bright yellow raincoat stands mid‑step on a funerary avenue of ancient stone, where silent balconies loom overhead like closed mouths; she cradles a warm golden egg against her chest with protective tenderness while a lean coyote pads beside her, gently nudging her sleeve as if urging her onward. Above them, a colossal Simurgh glides low between the buildings, its wings stitched with gold leaf and faint circuit‑like filigree that flickers in the air; a few luminous feathers fall and become tiny paper lanterns before touching the ground. In the girl’s other hand, a glowing nautilus shell pulses like a heartbeat, projecting a spiral staircase of light that curls out into the street and then impossibly threads through a gigantic arched ribcage embedded in the architecture—an anatomical impossibility forming the entrance to a hidden courtyard. A half‑burned candle floats at shoulder height, its wax dripping upward into the night, the flame casting long, uneasy shadows that crawl along the cobbles like living ink. On a high balcony, nearly invisible, a small ninja figure watches—still as a statue—holding a thin thread that seems connected to the egg, though it vanishes whenever you try to follow it. The environment is dense with story: moss‑veined mausoleum doors, rain‑slick cobblestones reflecting broken moonlight, balcony railings tangled with dead vines and metallic blossoms, distant shuttered windows with faint silhouettes, and scattered offerings (coins, petals, tiny masks) lining the street like a ritual path; the atmosphere blends creeping dread with gentle love, playful yet unsettling, dreamlike, richly detailed, surreal fairy‑tale realism.
