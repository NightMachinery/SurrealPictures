Vertical 2:3 — In a fossilized forest turned open-air amphitheater, a masked monarch with subtle sugar-skull face paint steps onto a stage of petrified roots, raising a caduceus whose twin serpents are made of translucent, half-solid “liquid” light; the glow pours downward, cooling into a braided friendship bracelet that gently loops through the hands, antlers, and branches of the audience, stitching strangers together as if healing an invisible wound. Behind the stage, an immense ancient cypress stands like a sacred monument, shown in an impossible isometric cutaway: its bark and canopy visible outside while its interior is simultaneously revealed as a warm domestic jewel-mine—tiny woodland workers whistling as they set gemstones into teacups, shelves, and stairways carved from amber resin, lanterns glowing in hollow chambers. Monarch butterflies swirl in disciplined spirals above the amphitheater, then break formation to land on the bracelet and the caduceus, as if crowning the moment; a single butterfly flies straight into the monarch’s mask, triggering an epiphany—hairline cracks in the paint open to a calm, human eye. The entire scene subtly repeats in four kaleidoscopic quadrants like a ceremonial tapestry, but one quadrant is intentionally “wrong”: the bracelet there unravels into floating punctuation marks and forgotten names, hinting at a different story. Rich, layered background full of carved fossil seats, distant ruins swallowed by roots, banners made of pressed leaves, mineral dust in the air, soft moon-and-lantern lighting, misty depth, dreamlike whimsy with an unsettling tenderness, high detail, narrative ambiguity, magical realism.
