Vertical 2:3 — Extreme low-angle view from the floor of a vast coral canyon-citadel: pearl staircases spiral upward through monumental shell-architecture like a drowned cathedral, every arch carved with tiny doorways and lantern niches. In the foreground, a traveling house floats just above the ground on a cloud of mismatched balloons; its front door is subtly personified into a weary face (knots as freckles, keyhole as a mouth) exhaling a ribbon of breath that becomes a path of paper birds. On the lowest pearl steps, a velvet-clad matchmaker who is also a marionette (porcelain cheeks, visible joints, thread spools for bracelets) leans in with surprising tenderness, using a small eternal flame held in cupped hands—warm, honey-gold, never consuming—to cauterize and gently sever the strings binding a prisoner high in a narrow tower window. The prisoner’s silhouette is half-reflected in a tall, freestanding magic mirror embedded in coral: in the mirror they appear already among a welcoming community below (strangers offering hands, a chorus of masked figures and sea-urchin street musicians), while in reality they still cling to the ledge. A charismatic outlaw partner in weathered fin-like coat climbs the pearl staircase toward them, one hand extended, the other gripping a bundle of cut strings that flutter like seaweed banners. Around the scene: floating shells filled with candlelight, tiny staircases leading nowhere, grief tokens tied to balloon cords (letters, dried flowers, a single child’s shoe), and watchful statues that look like upside-down towers. Atmosphere: drifting luminous spores like slow snow, gentle mist, warm flame-glow contrasting with cool bioluminescent corals; a sense of playful magic with an unsettling hush, as if rescue, reunion, and farewell are happening at once.
