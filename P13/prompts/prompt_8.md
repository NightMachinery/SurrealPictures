A paper-theater diorama seen head-on (2:3 vertical): visible layered cutout frames, tabs, and suspended scenery create a miniature stage where a barefoot commoner-child in patched clothes performs royal identity—wearing an oversized velvet mantle and a glowing victory wreath like a crown—while practicing a triumphant bow; behind them, a colossal “parent” figure made of fused cathedral architecture and living tree trunks leans in protectively, its stone hands gently cupping the stage as if it built the world. From a heraldic banner above, a golden lion crest peels itself off the fabric and becomes half-real, stepping forward through the paper layers to present a wrapped gift (the wrapping is a map of the city) to the child; the child’s expression is blinding euphoria, almost too bright to look at, casting prismatic light that spills through cutout windows. A giant leaf umbrella—veins like stained glass—hovers over the child, catching the radiant joy and scattering it into floating confetti-petals; in the deep background, terraced rooftops merge into vines, balconies sprout moss, streetlamps are fireflies in glass, and tiny masked townsfolk in the wings hold props and mirrors, unsure whether they’re audience or actors. Dreamlike, whimsical yet slightly unsettling, densely detailed environment, soft painterly surrealism, rich textures in every layer, luminous haze, dramatic rim light and warm glow against cool shadowed backstage.
