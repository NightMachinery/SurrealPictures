Vertical 2:3 illustration of a frozen fairy‑tale moment: inside a vast amphitheater carved into glacier arches, an ageing hermit‑mentor in patchwork robes gently guides an eager wilderness novice down the ice‑slick steps toward the stage, where a single lost slipper sits upright like a ceremonial relic—its hollow glowing, keyhole-shaped, as if waiting to unlock destiny; above them the aurora has become “emotional weather,” curling through the arches as translucent storm-fronts of color that rain soft luminous petals and faint snow-ash, shifting from tender pinks to anxious greens to grief-blue in layered bands; at center stage a giant skull half-buried in frost serves as a quiet shrine and instrument—its eye sockets filled with small ecosystems of flora/fauna fusion (ferns sprouting antlers, moths with leaf wings, foxes whose tails end in blossoms), while hairline cracks in the ice creep outward like entropy written in fractures; a tiny homunculus, childlike and solemn, stands on the skull’s brow holding a lantern shaped like the Faravahar, its wings casting symbolic shadow-feathers across the crowd of empty frozen seats and abandoned masks; the traveler’s weathered pack rests open nearby, spilling maps that slowly unravel into vines, and the hermit’s gloved hand steadies the novice’s shoulder with unmistakable tenderness; background packed with story clues—glacier corridors behind the arches like cathedral aisles, distant aurora-lit mountains, faint footprints that begin confidently then dissolve into drifting snow, suspended icicles like organ pipes, banners stitched from cloud-silk, and a thin river of meltwater reflecting upside-down constellations; lighting is soft, polar twilight with prismatic aurora rim-light, drifting glittering frost, subtle haze, and a playful-yet-unsettling calm as if the sky itself is teaching them how to feel.
