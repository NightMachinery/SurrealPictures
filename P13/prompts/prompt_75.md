A tide‑clock lighthouse at the edge of a black sea, its interior walls alive—breathing wallpaper of kelp, barnacles, and murmuring faces that ripple like tides—while an exhausted explorer in a soot-streaked coat climbs a spiral staircase of rusted ironwork and roots, dragging a glass “weather cage” that contains a miniature thunderstorm swirling in perfect silence; at the stroke of twelve, the lighthouse’s enormous clock hands lurch into alignment and the storm-in-a-dome flashes, casting moving shadows that reveal a hidden conflict: towering forest gods (antlered, moss-crowned, gentle and ancient) press in through cracked windows and grown-over doorways, trying to smother the invading modern machinery—pipes, pistons, and new steel beams that are bolted directly into living wood; above, a white Pegasus stands on a beam like a perched bird, wings folded, its halo caught midair as a floating brass ring that doubles as the tide dial, while a Faravahar-like emblem glows in stained glass behind it, shedding prismatic feathers across the room; outside the windows, a distant wildfire crawls along the horizon like a slow red serpent, separated by aching distance and salty haze, and the explorer—caught between longing and victory—reaches one hand toward the far shore while the other steadies a small laurel-crowned compass that points not north but “home”; the space feels impossibly deep, with telephoto-compressed layers of crowded planes—stacked balconies, overlapping stair landings, suspended platforms packed with curios (sea charts, burnt letters, iron masks, sprouting gears, candles made of waxed seashells)—all pressed together as if the lighthouse is bigger inside than the coastline itself; dreamlike, playful yet unsettling, soft moonlight braided with ember-glow and bioluminescent green, dust motes and ash drifting like snow, high detail, rich textured environment, frozen moment of surreal fairy-tale tension, portrait 2:3 aspect ratio.
