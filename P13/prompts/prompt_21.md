A colossal marigold-and-stone bridge arcs high above a sleeping ancestral metropolis, its lanterns shaped like folded love letters; on the bridge, two small lovers in traveling coats stand inside a half-assembled “home” made of stitched curtains and driftwood doors, sheltering a tiny basilisk curled like a cat by their feet—one lover holds a sealed letter to their chest while the other raises it toward an aurora-lit amphitheater carved into glacier arches in the distance, as if asking the sky for permission; behind them, a pumpkin on the bridge slowly transforms into a carriage wheel mid-spin, scattering glowing seeds that become little rooms and windows as they fall; below, the city’s rooftops are threaded with canals and balconies where translucent ancestors watch from open doorways, their faces reflected in puddles that burn with a small, steady eternal flame; overhead, a phoenix made of embers and snowfall bursts upward from a brazier at the center of the bridge, its wings forming a triumphant crown of light that makes everyone’s shadows dance in opposite directions; dreamlike magical realism, whimsical surrealism, intricate layered background, rich textures, soft unsettling mood, deep perspective, 2:3 vertical composition, aurora shimmer, ice-blue shadows, warm gold firelight, drifting snow, floating paper scraps, cinematic fairy-tale moment frozen mid-action.
