Vertical 2:3 illustration of a floating customs office for dream travelers hovering just above the border where an ancient, moss-laden forest meets a soot-black ironworks city: a long line of weary, oddly dressed passengers stands on a spiraling breadcrumb trail of glowing crumbs that rises from the ground into the air like a staircase. At the checkpoint, a gentle masked healer (wearing an ornate masquerade mask with tiny stitched smiles) leans over a trembling traveler, pouring warm light from a small ceramic vessel that contains an impossible eternal flame—its fire floats upward in slow droplets, turning into moths that circle the patient’s bruised memories. Nearby, a mirrored vanity has been bolted to a customs desk; it reflects not faces but anxious alternate selves, and a single bitten, poisoned-apple omen rolls across the counter, leaving a faint green shadow that everyone pretends not to see. Forest gods loom in the background as colossal tree-figures with bark crowns and root-hands, quietly pushing back against the ironworks: their vines tug at rivets, their leaves clog gears, while smokestacks exhale paper receipts that flutter like black snow. Gleeful trouble is happening—mischievous children levitate suitcases and stamp passports upside down, a customs clerk’s ink quill swims through the air like a fish, and community members in the line wordlessly steady one another with clasped hands and shared scarves. Rich, layered environment packed with story details (hanging lanterns made of cocoons, floating platforms held by rope and prayer flags, piles of dream contraband in glass jars, rusted signs in invented languages, distant furnaces glowing through fog), soft twilight lighting with warm flame-glow against cool mist, dreamy yet faintly unsettling atmosphere, high detail, magical realism, whimsical surrealism, cinematic depth.
