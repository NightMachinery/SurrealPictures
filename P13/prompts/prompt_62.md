A moonlit, partially sunken coastal city where an old astronomical observatory has flooded into a quiet underwater ballroom: inside its cracked glass domes, slow whales drift through as if they own the sky, brushing past hanging chandeliers of kelp and barnacle-crusted telescopes aimed at the deep. In the center, a lone dancer in a frilled suit of antique diving attire performs mid‑turn on a mosaic floor of star charts; her masquerade mask is porcelain-white and slightly too large, and her anatomy is impossible—one arm unfolds into a brass astrolabe, her ribcage opens like a small orrery, and her feet leave no footprints but tiny constellations that swirl behind her. She clutches a sealed love letter stamped with wax, yet the wax is a second star—bright, living—pulling her upward by an invisible thread toward the surface rooftops seen wavering above the dome like a distant stage set. All around, music is forbidden: violins, flutes, and gramophones sit in locked glass cabinets labeled only with family crests; their mouths are stitched shut with coral-red thread, and shadowy figures in the background (ancestors made of silt and paper) watch silently, their throats wrapped in old bandages as if silence has been inherited. A circular void in the water opens behind the dancer like a missing piece of reality—an ink-black portal where the night sky should be—spilling starless darkness into the room while bioluminescent plankton and drifting pages from a soaked library illuminate the scene with soft, unsettling wonder. Highly detailed, whimsical surrealism, dreamlike magical realism, rich textured background, cinematic composition, no text, 2:3 aspect ratio.
