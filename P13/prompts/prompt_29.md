A narrow 2:3 vertical scene: in a moonlit desert caravan avenue lined with sagging woven canopies and lanterns made from stitched parchment, a gleeful troublemaker child with porcelain **button eyes** tiptoes between sleeping camels, unspooling a ribbon of ink that doesn’t drip—**solid liquidity**—and as it snakes along the sand it erases footprints, names, and even shadows, turning them into pale moths that flutter toward a distant **void** shaped like an open well in the sky. At the avenue’s end, a calm **prophet** in a patched cloak stands on a small dune like a stage, holding a mirror that reflects not faces but missing memories; behind the prophet, a frozen **tidal wave** rises impossibly from nowhere, made of glassy water and suspended caravans, its crest forming luminous **Icarus wings** that are mid-molt into feathers and map fragments. The background is dense and story-rich: market stalls with half-blank storybooks, prayer flags woven from receipts, wind-carved statues with their inscriptions rubbed smooth, distant dunes patterned like fingerprints being wiped away; drifting sand mixes with foam, stars caught in the canopies’ threads, soft unsettling chiaroscuro lighting, dreamlike depth, playful yet ominous “something is about to happen” tension.
