A lone traveler in a billowing purple cape stands at the heart of a winding ice-shelf labyrinth, gently fastening a pair of shimmering, mismatched wings onto a timid, horned “beast” that looks half-bear, half-stag—its eyes wide with doubt as it tries to lift its paws from the snow; above them, an elegant white pegasus circles low like a patient mentor, leaving hoofprints of starlight in the air. The sky has been “replaced” like a torn stage backdrop: behind the aurora’s polar halos hangs a vast inverted night-ocean where constellations swim like luminous fish, and in one corner a clean, velvet-black void opens like a missing piece of reality. Suspended over the labyrinth’s central plaza is a colossal hourglass turned on its side, its “sand” bursting out as a cloud of glowing seeds, petals, and tiny lanterns that explode into exuberant life wherever they land—sprouting miniature gardens, fireworks of moss, and impossible flowers in the cracks of the ice. Around the scene, a muffled festival is underway: masked celebrants skate along the maze’s ridges, carrying ribbons and bells; their reflections ripple in frozen mirrors embedded in the walls. Etched into the ice above the traveler’s head, a radiant Faravahar-like emblem appears as a living relief, its wings subtly angled toward the beast as if offering silent instruction. Dreamlike, playful yet unsettling atmosphere; intricate, storybook detail in every surface (frost filigree, carved runes, layered footprints, distant tents, hanging pennants, crystalline arches); soft moonlight and auroral glow with deep shadows, sparkling highlights, and a sense of a single decisive moment just before the beast either believes—and rises—or collapses back into the maze (2:3 vertical composition).
