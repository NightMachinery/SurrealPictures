A lonely roadside bus stop on a vast storm-prarie at dusk: a small, barefoot child in a simple white raincoat stands perfectly statue-still on the bench, arms raised in a gentle “rain ritual,” face calm and innocent—yet their posture radiates quiet triumph, as if they’ve just won a secret battle. Around them, the world is violently in motion: grass bends in impossible spirals, paper tickets and prairie flowers orbit like tiny moons, and lightning keeps striking a ring of ancient wooden totems carved with half-erased faces and melting animal symbols. Behind the shelter, a hearth fire burns inside the transparent ad panel like a cozy living-room fireplace, casting warm light onto wet glass; raindrops on the panes look like miniature lanterns. In the distance a colossal tidal wave hangs upright on the horizon as if the ocean has stood up, its crest frozen mid-roar—inside the wave, faint silhouettes of commuters drift like spirits. A masked ninja figure (ambiguous scale, possibly a toy, possibly a giant guardian) crouches atop the bus stop roof, cape fluttering, watching over the child; their eyes glow softly, protective rather than threatening. A spirit visitation manifests as an enormous Cheshire-cat smile cut into the storm clouds—only the grin and a pair of faint eyes, amused and knowing—reflecting in puddles at the child’s feet. Subtle “avatar” cues: the child’s shadow does not match their body, instead showing a towering, serene giant version of themself standing in the same pose, as if the child is channeling something vast. Ultra-wide lens distortion with curving edges and bowed horizon, cinematic depth, dense background details (distant barns, flooded fields, leaning signposts, tangled power lines, flocks of paper-cranes), rain-silvered textures everywhere, dramatic contrast of cold storm light and warm hearth glow, dreamlike magical realism, whimsical yet unsettling, 2:3 vertical composition.
