A solitary minotaur hermit pauses mid-ritual in a crooked attic shrine, one hoof braced on a ladder as he reaches up to fasten a strand of impossibly long, glowing golden hair around the rafters like living twine; the hair spirals into a vast mandala pattern overhead, threading through hanging keys, dried herbs, tiny bells, and paper charms that tremble as if an invisible guest just brushed past. Two calm serpents rest on his shoulders like wary advisors, their tongues tasting the air toward an empty chair set for someone unseen; on the chair sits a worn satchel overflowing with “thank you” tokens—spilled pomegranates, stitched notes, and luminous coins—pouring into a small bowl that cannot contain the abundance, light pooling on the floorboards. A shaggy dog watches from below, its ornate collar formed of interlocking letters and brass dials; the collar’s mouth-like clasp is half-open as if speaking, while a mischievous shadow on the wall (a trickster’s silhouette) tugs the dog’s leash even though no hand holds it. The attic is richly cluttered: cracked stained-glass skylight showing a starless dawn, shelves of dust-heavy books and bottled storms, moth-eaten tapestries, carved masks, and a window revealing distant mountains wrapped in fog; warm lantern glow battles cool blue drafts, casting soft, unsettling double-shadows and a halo around the golden hair as the whole room feels seconds away from either blessing or prank.
