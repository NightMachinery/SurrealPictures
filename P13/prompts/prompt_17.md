A moonlit workshop built around an ancient wishing well inside a crooked, storybook clocktower: a weary inventor in a patched coat warms their hands over a half-burned candle balanced on the rim, while the candle’s smoke coils into a living caduceus that slithers up the gears and disappears into a triangular seeing-stone (a stone triangle with a clean hole) mounted like a lens in the wall; through the hole, the same scene repeats smaller and smaller in infinite recursion, each loop subtly wrong—tools rearranged, shadows facing the wrong direction, the inventor’s expression changing—until it becomes unsettling. A glossy black crow stands on a stack of blueprints, tugging at a thread of smoke as if trying to unravel it. On the inventor’s outstretched finger, a bright blue bird perches calmly, its tiny feet leaving ink-blue footprints that turn into winding staircases across the paper. The well’s water reflects a warm hearth that isn’t there, casting cozy amber light upward, yet the corners of the room are swallowed by slow, creeping dread: elongated shadows creep like ivy, brass automata peek from drawers, and faint chalk symbols crawl across the brickwork. Background packed with layered details—hanging lanterns, dangling keys, shelves of cracked glass, maps of impossible cities, melted wax drips forming miniature mountains, a spiral staircase wrapped around the well, distant rooftops seen through rain-streaked windows—soft magical glow versus cold silvery moonlight, floating dust motes, mist rising from the well, dreamlike fairy-tale surrealism, painterly whimsical realism, high detail, cinematic composition, 2:3 vertical.
