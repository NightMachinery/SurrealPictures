A deserted funerary avenue stretches toward a vanishing point, flanked by tall, soot-stained buildings whose countless balconies are crowded with silent, faceless onlookers made of stone and folded paper—some leaning forward as if listening, none casting the same shadow twice. In the center of the avenue stands an abandoned maypole planted in cracked marble, wrapped in ribbons of lace stitched to thin steel strips; the ribbons tug and knot themselves into impossible braids that resemble a living logic puzzle. A dancer-cartographer spins at the base of the pole, tracing a map in midair with a compass that has no needle—only a rotating compass rose that projects cardinal directions onto the street like moving spotlights; her anatomy is subtly wrong: too many elegant joints in her arms, a spine that loops like a Möbius strip, feet that never quite touch the ground. Each pirouette snaps new streets into existence: tiled pavements rearrange into sliding riddle-box patterns, alleys open where none were, staircases climb into balconies and return to the street upside-down. Above, a flock of origami birds pours from an open window, unfolding as they fly—paper turning to feather, feather turning to parchment covered in cryptic symbols—then refolding into sharp angles whenever someone on a balcony blinks. At the top of the maypole hangs a broken crown, split and drifting apart like two moons, its fragments tugged by the lace-and-steel ribbons as if the pole is trying to reassemble authority from scraps. In the foreground, a wide-eyed child kneels by a chalk-drawn map that refuses to stay flat, its coastlines rising into miniature cliffs; the child’s hand hovers in wonder, afraid to touch the tiny shifting city that mirrors the real one. Dust motes glitter in a late-afternoon haze; warm golden light collides with cool blue shadow under the balconies, creating a playful yet unsettling dream atmosphere where every detail hints at a solvable riddle that keeps changing the rules. Vertical composition (2:3), richly layered background packed with symbolic objects, subtle motion frozen mid-transformation, fairy-tale surrealism with intricate textures and storytelling clarity through ambiguity.
