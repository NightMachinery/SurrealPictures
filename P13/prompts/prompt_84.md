A vertical 2:3 Dixit card illustration: on a narrow bridge-bazaar suspended between two enormous cracked bell towers, a lone street musician stands mid-performance on a tiny dais of “solidified water” (stone that ripples like a pond), bowing a strange instrument whose glowing notes arc outward and harden into two crossed, childlike laser-swords above the crowd; nearby, an elegant hare in a patched merchant coat offers comedy/tragedy masks that breathe faint mist, while carnival-glass trinkets and confetti orbit the stalls as if caught in slow gravity. From the chasm beneath the bridge, sea-witch tentacles rise quietly between hanging rugs and lanterns, rearranging the market into a gentle labyrinth—pathways curling, stalls shifting, staircases folding back into themselves—yet everyone acts as if it’s normal. A legendary, tattered jeweled banner (ancient royal standard) flutters from the bell tower, its embroidered sun catching starlight; behind it, a colossal beanstalk-vine climbs past the towers into a cosmic sky where distant constellations feel uncomfortably close. Rich background details: crowded miniature shops wedged into tower alcoves, bells filled with moss and tiny apartments, strings of mask-lanterns, spilled spices, maps, mirrored shards, floating feathers, and puddles reflecting impossible architecture; dreamy moonlit atmosphere with soft aurora glow, warm lantern pools, and a playful-yet-unsettling sense that the world is gently re-writing itself mid-song.
