A 2:3 portrait scene that feels like a tall, panoramic fairy-tale: in the foreground, a faceless wanderer in a patchwork coat stands on a mossy stone terrace, holding a delicate marionette control-cross carved like an ankh; instead of strings, thin sunrise-gold threads rise into the air and attach to a flock of origami cranes that beat like living birds, lifting and steering a hollow, smiling mask that floats just ahead as if it’s the wanderer’s “face.” The action is mid-flight rehearsal: the cranes tug the mask toward an immense “Sunrise Gate” archway made of broken rice-terrace walls stacked impossibly upright, each terrace forming a vertical layer of the world like steps into the sky; tiny calm ripples move through flooded paddies clinging to these walls, reflecting scenes that don’t match reality (a hand where there is no hand, a face in water where there is no face). In the middle distance, real cranes (birds) and silent construction cranes coexist, gently rebuilding the terraced ruins with bundles of reeds and glowing stones, as if repairing emotions into architecture; scattered offerings—paper prayers, lantern seeds, cracked porcelain eyes—dot the ledges. Far above, a leaning lighthouse grows from the terraces like a pale tree, its beam not bright but soft and velvety, sweeping through mist to “test” the threads; when the beam touches the marionette-strings they thicken into confident ribbons, and when it misses they fray into anxious hairline filaments, showing flight confidence tied to self-belief. The mood is deep serenity with an unsettling undertone: tranquil water, slow drifting fog, and warm dawn light, yet the mask keeps turning to look at the viewer while remaining empty. Rich background detail: layered terraces vanishing upward into cloud shelves, distant villages half-swallowed by rice and vines, reflective pools holding alternate skies, and a faint procession of tiny faceless figures crossing bridges made from loom shuttles and broken compasses, all under a sunrise that feels like a quiet spell being cast.
