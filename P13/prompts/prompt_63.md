A lone masked celebrant in a faded carnival ballroom kneels to cradle a warm, glowing golden egg like a newborn, gently shielding it with one hand while offering a bite of a poison-red apple with the other; above them, hundreds of origami paper birds orbit in a slow, ritual spiral, each wingbeat folding and unfolding the same moment like a looping ceremony. Behind, a gigantic stopped clock hangs crooked over the stage—its frozen hands doubled by a tall, tarnished mirror that reflects a different time and a different face, amplifying vanity and quiet panic; in the mirror the apple’s shine becomes an omen, and the egg’s light looks fragile, almost bruised. Scale inversion everywhere: tiny ballroom doors open onto vast starless corridors, a colossal teacup serves as a fountain, and distant miniature dancers move like wind-up toys on the floor’s cracked chessboard tiles. The environment is richly layered—peeling velvet curtains, moth-eaten banners, scattered confetti mixed with ash, gilt frames sprouting mushrooms, candle wax pooling into river-deltas, delicate feathers caught in cobwebs—suggesting a cycle repeating for years. Soft twilight filters through stained glass, mixing with warm candle halos and drifting dust motes; the mood is tender yet unsettling, playful magic with a sharp edge, a frozen fairy-tale moment just before something hatches or breaks (vertical 2:3 composition, no text).
