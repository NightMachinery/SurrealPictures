A colossal, hooded artisan kneels in sacred silence at the center of a pearl-reef amphitheater revealed by a shallow tide under pale moonlight, the whole scene tilted in a dramatic Dutch angle as cascading diagonals of stairs, coral ribs, and hanging kelp-ribbons seem to slide toward the foreground; on the artisan’s right hand is a translucent ice glove—frosted, cracked, and glittering—carefully cupping a half-burned candle whose flame is alive but eerily quiet, and whose melted wax spills upward against gravity, unfolding into a hovering lotus made of warm wax-petals and cold rime; from the lotus rises a swarm of tiny flora-fauna hybrids (moths with fern fronds for wings, bees with pearl bodies, fish with pollen-dusted fins) carrying threads of glowing wax like incense, weaving them into a growing, intricate lattice that turns a single emotion—simple devotion—into a complex braid of awe, tenderness, dread, and longing; behind the amphitheater, a monumental “Gate of All Nations” stands half-submerged: an archway assembled from mismatched doorframes, carved lintels, ship prows, and street signs in many alphabets, each gently ringing with salt-crystals as if listening; scattered around are offerings and tools—chisels made of bone, spools of kelp-fiber, shells etched with maps, tiny masks, fallen flags—while the reef itself forms faces and animals in its textures, watching; moonlight and bioluminescence intermix, casting soft, unsettling highlights through mist and sea-spray, with drifting pearls and weightless wax-lotus petals suspended midair as if the world is deciding whether to sink or ascend.
