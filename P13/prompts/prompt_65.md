A veiled widow–clockmaker presides over a tea party in the nave of a colossal textile factory where looms rise like pipe-organs and weaving shuttles glide like altar servers; she balances a tiny blue bird on her gloved finger as it “corrects” etiquette—each time a rule is followed, the guests (empty coats, gloves, and masks) become more rigidly arranged, and each time a rule is broken, the table setting rewinds, forks unbending and tea swirling back into cups; at the head of the table sits an impossible chalice—part holy grail, part thimble—filled not with tea but with a softly pulsing void that drinks sound, while a music box on her lap spills luminous memory-projections into the air: drifting tapestry-scenes of childhood, grief, and laughter that stitch themselves into the hanging velvet curtains; ash falls like gentle snow from the rafters, dusting gears and lace, yet every ash-flake transforms into a tiny numbered clockface before dissolving; in the deep background, stained-glass windows reveal a lightning-struck tree outside, still smoldering, its fractured branches mirroring the factory’s broken beams; the widow’s posture suggests sudden relief, as if an invisible weight has just lifted—her mourning veil loosening into thread that unspools upward into constellations; richly layered environment packed with spools, bobbins, brass dials, embroidered etiquette cards, steam, and moths, with warm candlelight battling cool moonlight, drifting sparks, long shadows, and a dreamlike, playful-yet-unsettling fairy-tale atmosphere (vertical 2:3)
