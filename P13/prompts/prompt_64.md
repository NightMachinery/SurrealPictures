Vertical 2:3 composition — inside a vast sunken observatory palace on the seafloor: cracked glass domes overhead where enormous whales glide silently *through the domes as if they’re portals to the sky*, scattering constellations of plankton-light; the entire room is caught in a gentle gravity reversal—brass astrolabes, torn star-maps, feathered quills, and drifting candles rise upward like a slow-motion snowfall in reverse, while pools of seawater hang midair as perfectly spherical lenses. At the center, a lone Celebrant in weathered ceremonial finery stands on a spiral staircase that curls into darkness, holding a sun-crest flag that glows like a small sunrise; their face is half-smiling, half-ruined by beautiful grief, as if honoring a victory that cost too much. Beside them floats a cradle made from an antique telescope tube, rocking itself in the air; inside it, not a child but a small, sleeping “beast” of shadow and starlight, breathing gently, tethered by thin luminous threads that bind the whole scene together like an unseen force. Along the walls, a heraldic lion carved in stone begins to wake—its mane is a mosaic of shells and gold leaf, its eyes lit from within—while the Celebrant’s music (from an unseen instrument) materializes as translucent ribbons and paper-thin birds, spiraling into the air and wrapping the lion’s paws like a coronation. Rich background detail everywhere: coral growing over velvet curtains, barnacles on marble columns, shelves of soaked books with ink bleeding into tiny galaxies, broken lenses reflecting impossible suns, distant doorways opening onto flooded corridors with drifting masks and abandoned medals. Lighting is dreamlike and cinematic: cold teal depth punctuated by warm sun-gold from the flag and candle halos trapped in bubbles; soft silt motes, drifting petals, and faint aurora-like reflections make the moment feel sacred, playful, unsettling, and mythic.
