Centered one-point-perspective scene (vertical 2:3) with exaggerated depth lines: inside a colossal ritual archive carved from dark whale-bone and sea-polished stone, endless shelves and rolling ladder-tracks converging to a single vanishing point; whale-oil lanterns hang like small moons, their smoke forming translucent musical staffs—each flicker rings visibly as colored notes, and scents spill as soft ribbons of light (synesthetic atmosphere). In the foreground, an innocent-looking child in an oversized alchemist’s coat stands mid-action, reaching into an ornate, half-open “Pandora” coffer that is releasing fluttering nameplates, signatures, and passport-stamp sigils like moths; a thin golden halo hovers slightly off-center above the child, as if misaligned with their true identity. A mischievous brass insect-drone (dragonfly camera body, quill-needle legs) darts away holding a stolen name-tag in its claw, projecting a beam that tries to relabel the child; the child counters by tilting a cracked hand-mirror that catches two vivid reflections—one red, one blue—like pills of choice hovering in the glass. Suspended between them, a floating hourglass leaks not sand but tiny letters, falling upward into the shelves; as the letters drift, some books change titles, faces in portrait spines subtly rearrange, and the corridor’s catalog signage rewrites itself in real time. Background packed with story details: wax seals, salt-stained scrolls, star-maps pinned over tide charts, ink bowls with impossible colors, tiny footprints on dust, and hidden doors between volumes; soft, dreamlike lighting with long lantern-cast shadows, playful yet unsettling tension, a frozen moment of identity recovery just before the drone escapes.
