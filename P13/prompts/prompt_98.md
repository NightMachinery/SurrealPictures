A lone scientist in a raincoat stands at a deserted seaside bus stop at twilight, performing a quiet, defiant “rain ritual”: they strike a tiny flame inside a glass vial and hold it up to the downpour as if refusing the weather itself; the flame doesn’t go out—instead it makes the raindrops glow like molten pearls. Around them, the scene is a single layered tableau where *before-and-after* echoes coexist: a wilting bouquet in their hand appears twice at once—fresh blossoms ghosted over browned petals—while behind them the same bus stop sign is simultaneously newly painted and rusted through, the peeling paint hovering like a transparent memory. The ground is a puddled mosaic of coral branches and mother-of-pearl tiles, and from the curb rises a strange Jacob’s-ladder staircase made of mismatched steps (stone, wood, bone, shell) that is actively reconfiguring itself midair, rerouting like a living topology: each time a spirit steps onto it, the next steps swing into a different destination, subtly rearranging the social order of the waiting crowd. Those “commuters” are uncanny: translucent visitors in old-fashioned attire, some carrying heirlooms—lockets, framed portraits, a crown of keys—offering them forward like an inheritance being transferred; one spirit is child-sized but casts an enormous adult shadow, while a towering spirit stoops to cradle a tiny suitcase, creating a gentle scale inversion throughout the scene. In the background, a wet coastal town climbs a cliff in miniature, lantern-lit windows flickering inside raindrops stuck in midair; distant waves curl into staircase shapes, and an abandoned bus—half barnacle, half velvet upholstery—idles with its doors open, interior glowing warmly like a promise. The scientist’s expression is calm but resolute, caught between curiosity and refusal, as the spirits lean in: some comforting, some judging, all ambiguous; the air is thick with mist, haloed streetlights, and rain that falls in slow ribbons, soft yet unsettling, dreamlike, richly textured, no text, no borders, 2:3 composition.
