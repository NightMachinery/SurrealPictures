Vertical 2:3 composition: On an underwater “kelp forest boulevard,” drifting market stalls line a cobblestone street that vanishes into teal haze; vendors are absent, yet bunting, paper lanterns, and confetti-like bubbles still swirl as if a festival has just ended. At the center, a calm horse—half real, half mechanical topiary—stands with brass vines for tendons and tiny clockwork fish clicking inside its transparent ribcage; it carries a sealed love letter in its mouth, the wax stamp softened and bleeding ink into the water like a bruise of nostalgia. Beside it floats a shredded wooden door, splintered into ribbons, opening onto a warm, sunlit courtyard from another time; the portal “displaces” objects so they hang mid-translation—an old teacup, a child’s ribbon, a fading photograph—caught between sea and memory. Reaching through the doorway is a gloved hand made of ice, gently pressing the letter toward a lone Shadow that has detached from any body and stands upright on the street like a person; the Shadow holds the envelope with startling tenderness, as if afraid to tear it, while its edges flutter like kelp. In the background, a colossal cypress tree rises impossibly from the seafloor like a sacred monument, its branches studded with small glowing shells and broken music boxes, casting intricate lacework silhouettes across storefronts grown into coral and rusted gears. Soft, dreamlike lighting: bioluminescent greens and lantern ambers, dust-motes of plankton sparkling in the water; a faint current carries streamers and petals past the door, suggesting celebration and farewell at once, playful yet unsettling, as if the street is waiting for someone to step through and claim their shadow.
