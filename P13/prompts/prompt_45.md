A tall 2:3 vertical scene in centered one-point perspective: inside a tide-clock lighthouse whose corridor stretches away with exaggerated depth lines, the interior walls subtly alive—breathing plaster, eyelids in the mortar, veins running beneath Persian tilework glazed in lapis lazuli. In the foreground, a widow stands in a strict profile portrait split cleanly by the lighthouse’s central architectural axis (a doorway/pillar bisecting her face); on one side she is wrapped in mourning black, on the other her silhouette is filled with luminous sky as if the building has replaced her skin. Around her, a time-lapse collage effect shows repeated translucent phases of her figure stepping forward, hesitating, then turning back, like memories caught in long exposure. A hearth is set into the wall like a shrine; within it a small fire demon curls and grins, feeding on old letters, its flames forming brief skull-shapes that rise and dissolve into ash. Dozens of paper lanterns drift through the corridor as if a lantern festival has invaded the lighthouse—each lantern contains a tiny scene from her past, and as she reaches toward one, the entire space reacts: tiles rearrange, wallpaper peels into constellations, furniture gently unburdens itself and floats a few inches, conveying sudden relief (a weight lifted) amid creeping entropy (crumbling edges, sand accumulating, clockwork rust blooming). At the far end, an open circular lens-room frames a “sky replacement” vista: the aurora borealis hangs impossibly close, like a curtain being drawn by unseen hands; its green-violet light pours down the corridor, mixing with warm hearth-glow, casting long, soft, unsettling shadows and revealing hidden faces in the tile reliefs. Dreamlike, whimsical magical realism with rich, story-dense background details everywhere, frozen mid-revelation.
