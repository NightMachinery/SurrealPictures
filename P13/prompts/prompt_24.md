A solemn young exile in a rain-slick neon-and-concrete city steps beneath a torn wedding canopy stretched between two brutalist rooftops; a gentle healer in patched robes tilts the exile’s chin and touches a thin lightning-shaped scar with a needle of light while the exile’s round glasses reflect a vision of their father’s face formed from storm clouds overhead; from a cracked rooftop pool, “solid” liquid like crystal-water rises in a slow spiral, hardening into a precarious Jacob’s ladder that climbs into the sky-vision, each rung holding tiny floating diorama-memories (childhood rooms, faded letters, a crown made of dust) that glow with nostalgia; a calm skull-shaped building looms in the midground, its hollow eye sockets lit like quiet apartments, and from its mouth pours a controlled swarm of luminous moths carrying scraps of vows and old photographs, circling the canopy as if blessing or warning; despite the surrounding motion, the exile’s expression is perfect stillness—contentment tinged with dread—as the healer’s hand steadies them; richly detailed background of layered alleys, wet posters peeling from concrete pillars, rooftop gardens in broken teacups, distant elevated trains, puddles mirroring upside-down constellations, and faint silhouettes watching from balconies; dreamlike soft fog, prismatic rain, warm lantern-glow under the canopy contrasting with cold cyan streetlight, cinematic depth, intricate textures, surreal fairy-tale realism, ambiguous symbolism, 2:3 vertical composition.
