A lantern-lit townhouse interior that folds into endless stairwells and balconies, each landing overgrown with wheat, pumpkins, and ivy that merge seamlessly into carved banisters and cracked plaster; at the center, a tired prophet in a robe patterned like an orange clownfish has just set down a huge bundle of smooth river stones from their shoulders—caught mid-drop as if the weight has finally lifted—while they lean toward a hearth fire that burns with quiet blue-gold flames; from the fire rises a floating golden egg, hairline-cracked, casting warm light onto a wilting bouquet in the prophet’s hand as the petals fall and transform into scattered seeds that sprout into miniature harvest fields across the floorboards; above, the ceiling opens into a starless void where constellations are being stitched into existence by a colossal spider on silver threads, its web spanning between staircases like bridges; in a shadowed archway, a curved window frame forms an unsettling, catbus-like grin of lit panes watching the scene; rich background clutter—dusty books, hanging laundry, tiny doors, stacked lanterns, and old portraits whose eyes are tiny galaxies—soft dreamlike atmosphere, swirling embers and drifting pollen, deep perspective, painterly surreal magical realism, intricate textures, ambiguous fairy-tale tension, 2:3 vertical composition.
