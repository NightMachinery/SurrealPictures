Bird’s-eye view, intricate tabletop diorama of a monolithic basalt coastline made of hexagonal columns, tidepools like stained-glass windows, and tiny mossy staircases; under a perpetual green-violet aurora the whole coast is actually the “Ship of Theseus” rebuilt into land—mismatched planks, patched sails, old figureheads, and rope bridges forming cliffs and streets—while a kneeling giant at the shoreline gently presses glowing control-console buttons set into the rock, and each button-press causes parts of the diorama to fracture and reassemble into new versions of themselves (visible floating shards, mismatched replacement pieces, impossible joins). At the center, a luminous Tree of Life grows from the ship’s broken mast, its roots threading through hull ribs, its branches holding hundreds of tiny narrative clusters like ornaments: a solemn lynx in a tiny captain’s coat bargains with a crew of thumb-sized sailors, exchanging its own constellation-like spots for a brass compass and a single warm lantern flame; nearby, a pumpkin on a cobbled deck is mid-metamorphosis into a carriage wheel—one half rind, one half carved wood—rolling away on its own with playful urgency; elsewhere, miniature masked pilgrims offer feathers into a bowl and receive new memories as paper boats. Above everything, the Simurgh circles with vast mosaic wings, shedding iridescent feather-fragments that become fresh diorama pieces as they fall, implying a quiet sacrifice that keeps the world repaired; soft dreamlike mist, aurora reflections in wet basalt, candlelit windows in ship-plank houses, whimsical detail everywhere, gentle humor with an unsettling sense of control, high fidelity, rich layered background, painterly surreal magical realism, 2:3 aspect ratio.
