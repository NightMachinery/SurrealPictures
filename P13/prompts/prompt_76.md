A vast, ornament-first scene where intricate Persian-inspired patterns and filigree dominate the entire image: inside a labyrinthine sky-bazaar that is also a library, a gentle marionette-tender (visible strings vanishing into the painted ceiling) kneels beside a small child and guides their hands as they cradle a **stopped clock** like a wounded bird; the child’s tearful smile shows **tender love** as the clock’s frozen hands begin to move again. Around them, scattered toys quietly **transmute** into ornate ornaments mid-action—tin soldiers becoming gilded leaves, a stuffed fox unfolding into a brooch, a wooden horse turning into a carved clockwork motif—yet the transformation feels celebratory, like a private **victory** over time. Behind them, a monumental **Faravahar** appears as a mosaic window-rose and as repeating embroidery, echoing infinitely in nested frames, mirrors, and clockfaces—an **infinite recursion** of the same tender scene within scenes. A giant **leaf umbrella** arches overhead like a living canopy, its veins lit from within, shedding soft green light and tiny drifting seeds that resemble miniature clock gears. On a nearby hook hangs a fogged **diver’s mask** with a paper address label tied to it, as if it’s waiting to be delivered to someone who lives underwater or in a dream. Through tall arched windows, a **black sun** burns silently in a lilac sky while a **planetary archive**—rings of tiny orbiting book-satellites, scrolls, and index cards—circles it like a solemn halo, their pages fluttering in vacuum. The ground is a dense tapestry of rugs, stairways, and shelves that loop back into themselves; distant merchants are only hinted at by patterned silhouettes embedded in wallpaper. Soft, dust-mote atmosphere; warm golds and cool sea-glass greens; subtle unsettling calm; cinematic depth, rich layered background, surreal fairy-tale realism, vertical 2:3 composition.
