A vertical 2:3 Dixit card illustration of a weary traveler at a vast “Gate of All Nations” that doubles as a labyrinthine border checkpoint between two incompatible seasons: to the left, an ancient mossy forest in warm late-summer light where quiet, antler-crowned forest gods watch from tree hollows; to the right, a neon-and-concrete ironworks city under cold sleeting twilight, smokestacks exhaling auroras and scaffolds wrapped in banner-like shadows. The scene is an isometric cutaway of the gate itself, revealing exterior and interior simultaneously: inside, a maze of tiny offices, staircases, and corridors made of soft-sculpture architecture—concrete draped like fabric, riveted metal bending like velvet—where clerks made of pine bark and brass exchange stamped leaves and glowing tickets. At the main counter, the traveler offers an enormous golden egg cradled in their arms like fragile luggage, while a calm tiger sits beside them as both guardian and confidant, partially hidden behind a symbolic apparatus: a towering passport machine built from a golden oil lamp, astrolabe rings, and looping conveyor belts that pour “solid liquidity” (molten metal flowing like water, water reflecting like polished steel) into stamp-shaped molds. Above, a bright kite is tethered to the traveler’s wrist and floats through the gate’s open rafters like a messenger, its tail threaded through the maze to mark a path, implying something is actively being smuggled or saved. The traveler and a small forest spirit share a moment of intimate quiet closeness—fingers touching under the counter, almost secret—while the lamp-machine’s light casts warm gold on their hands and cold neon on their faces, filling the whole layered environment with playful, unsettling dream logic, intricate background detail, and a frozen-storybeat sense that a single decision will decide which season gets to cross.
