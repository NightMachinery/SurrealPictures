A clockwork orphanage at the edge of a vast night-forest: inside a towering hall of interlocking gears and hundreds of mismatched puzzle-doors (each engraved with riddles, constellations, and tiny keyholes), an ageing recluse mentor stands behind a veil of translucent hanging textiles like a stage curtain, watching through layered gauze as an eager wilderness novice kneels on the tiled floor, carefully placing a breadcrumb trail that becomes luminous as it crosses into the room—each crumb turning into a small floating star. Between them, a cracked hourglass hangs upside-down in midair; instead of sand, a slow eternal flame pours through its narrow waist, falling upward as embers that assemble into a calm, faceless “avatar” descending from the ceiling like a celestial visitor. A palm-sized homunculus (part clockwork, part clay) tugs determinedly at a ribbon tied to the novice’s wrist, as if urging stoic strength, while a surreal flamingo croquet mallet leans against a doorframe, its beak poised like a key. The environment is richly cluttered with orphaned toys, paper maps, worn boots, cogs, and stitched quilts draped over banisters; beyond broken windows, the forest presses close with impossible, oversized leaves and distant lanterns. Soft dreamlike lighting: warm ember-glow from the flame-hourglass mingling with cool moonlight shafts, dust motes sparkling in the air, gentle but unsettling fairy-tale tension, painterly surreal whimsy, high detail, 2:3 aspect ratio.
