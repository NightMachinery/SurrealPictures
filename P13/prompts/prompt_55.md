Over-the-shoulder viewpoint of a faceless bathhouse attendant (smooth porcelain head, no features) holding a steaming basin and a contract scroll wrapped around their wrists like binding bandages, peering into a ritual banquet deep inside a labyrinth of basalt tunnels: in the center, a colossal Giant sits at an impossibly long feast table draped in velvet that crumbles into ash at the edges, while masked guests made of folded towels and chimney soot perform a slow rite around an Eternal Flame (a white-gold fire that burns without consuming) set in a turtle-shell-patterned mosaic floor; black glass bottles of captured thunder line the table like wine, each one swirling with miniature storm clouds that occasionally flash and illuminate hidden corridor maps carved into the rock, and a Raven officiant perches on a ladle-staff, dropping glittering salt that turns bathwater into mercury and then into tiny silver fish; far down the winding passages, a single distant doorway glows with warm home-light, pulling the attendant’s posture into an aching lean of longing, as if the whole scene is a job they cannot quit; dense background details everywhere (hanging copper pipes, wet stone inscriptions, paper talismans, soot-snow drifting in steam, stacks of folded linens like altar steps, labyrinth shadows forming repeating shell patterns), cinematic dreamlike atmosphere, soft unsettling whimsy, dramatic rim light from the flame and intermittent lightning-in-a-bottle highlights, high fidelity, richly layered, vertical 2:3 composition, no text.
