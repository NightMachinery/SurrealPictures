Isometric cutaway scene of a colossal ancient cypress tree rising from a deserted, war-scarred town, the tree’s trunk hollowed into a lived-in home whose interior and exterior are visible at once: inside, a veiled widow kneels on a mosaic floor, winding a delicate music box; as the lid opens, luminous notes drift out like fireflies and fold into tiny paper cranes that fly through a cracked mirror propped against the wall. In the mirror’s reflection, the same room becomes a battlefield that has forgotten itself—rusted helmets turned into flowerpots, broken rifles sprouting poppies, toy-like tanks half-buried in sand—while the widow’s hands in the reflection rapidly age and un-age in a looping curse, skin turning to bark and back again, rings sliding over knotted wood. A large, flamboyantly colored tropical bird perches on a root-beam like a watchful herald, stealing one glowing note in its beak; wherever it drops the note, objects soften into peace: a torn flag becomes a quilt, shrapnel becomes beads, a bomb casing becomes a lantern. The interior is dense with story details—threadbare tapestries depicting the cypress’s legend, shelves of dusty glass animals, abandoned letters, a child’s empty boots, spilled pomegranates, tiny framed portraits that have no faces—while outside, alleys are choked with drifting sand, collapsed balconies, silent propaganda posters peeling into abstract patterns, and distant mountains shaped like sleeping giants. Dream-logic transitions blend rooms into streets: a staircase climbs out of the house and ends in open sky; a window opens onto an ocean; roots pierce walls and become cobblestone roads. Lighting is twilight-gold and moon-cool at once, with shafts of radiant, transcendent bliss pouring from the music box and the mirror, dust motes glittering in the air, playful yet unsettling calm, richly textured backgrounds everywhere, cinematic depth, 2:3 composition.
