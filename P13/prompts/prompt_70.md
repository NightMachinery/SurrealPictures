A bird’s-eye cutaway diorama of a vast valley where an ancient forest temple and a soot-black ironworks are fused into one impossible structure: on the left, towering mossy statues of half-awake forest gods lean from the canopy, threading living roots through gears; on the right, riveted smokestacks exhale soft steam that turns into clouds shaped like hands. In the center, a lone traveler in patched clothes levitates a few inches above a cracked bridge, reaching toward a distant child across a widening gap; the traveler’s heel glows painfully through a torn boot, wrapped in a delicate iron clamp as if the whole scene hinges on that vulnerability. Below them, the ground is sliced open to reveal a subterranean “mint” where coins are grown like fruit—gold discs budding on pale stems under lanternlight, tended by tiny workers in aprons who water them with shimmering liquid metal that pours like a river yet stacks into solid steps (“fluid solidity”). Near the bridge, a crocodile made of lacquered wood and brass crawls along a conveyor belt; its ribcage is a clockwork cage, and each tooth is a ticking second hand—yet above, a massive stopped clock face is embedded in the roots of a legendary cypress whose trunk rises like a dark obelisk, its needles glittering with suspended time. Scatter miniature narrative clusters throughout the environment (a god’s fingertip gently pinching a smokestack closed; a child hiding a seed-coin in a pocket; a worker listening to the crocodile like an oracle; birds carrying tiny cog-flowers), all richly detailed with layered textures, carved inscriptions, rust, lichens, paper notices, and drifting ash. Dreamlike twilight lighting: cool forest blues colliding with warm forge ambers, floating dust motes and fireflies, soft haze, unsettling calm with playful wonder; vertical 2:3 composition, crisp focal storytelling with abundant background detail and subtle surreal symbolism.
