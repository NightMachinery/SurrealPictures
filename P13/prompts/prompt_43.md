A small child in an oversized employee badge embraces their shy, moss-covered sea-monster friend as they quietly slide a heavy coral crown off the head of a stern “father-king” made of barnacled office furniture; the king slumps in sudden, human relief as if a weight has been lifted. The scene is staged like a perfectly symmetrical altar in the center of an opulent undersea corporate court: twin columns of glass filing cabinets filled with drifting jellyfish, mirrored rows of pearl-studded chairs for silent courtiers, and a polished black stone dais—yet tiny hidden asymmetries betray rebellion (one side’s candles burn in air bubbles, the other side’s flames are replaced by tiny fish; one curtain is stitched with contracts, the other with torn signatures). On the altar between them rests a single poisoned apple split open to reveal a miniature revolving door inside, and behind it rises a tattered Derafsh Kaviani banner reimagined as a luminous sea-silk standard with constellations embroidered like old protest slogans. A portal misaligned in the back wall (like a skewed picture frame) shows a celestial dry dock where comets are being repaired like dented boats—astral mechanics hammering starlight onto cracked tails—while the portal’s edge spills misplaced gravity into the room, lifting papers, crowns, and bubbles upward in slow spirals. Through the domed ceiling, an underwater volcano glows faintly, sending warm ash-like snow that settles on the “home” the child and monster have built in a corner: a little shelter made from a toppled executive desk, stitched blankets, and rescued nameplates turned into wind chimes. Dreamlike, playful yet unsettling, dense layered background detail, soft cinematic lighting with bioluminescent highlights and deep ocean shadow, frozen mid-action as the court decides whether to rise or remain silent, vertical 2:3 composition.
