A monumental, weathered stone face half-buried in cracked salt flats at twilight, eyes open and calm; in each iris, a miniature living world is reflected—an entire traveling circus-caravan city parked on the blinding white salt, stitched together from neon signs, concrete balconies, and patched velvet tents—where two lovers in mismatched masks balance on a tightrope made of taut, shimmering soundwaves, their feet sending visible ripples of resonance through the tiny streets; below them, a gleeful band of seven soot-smudged, dwarf-like ironworkers secretly “improves” the show by transmuting scraps of metal into sprouting vines and turning salt into confetti, while towering forest gods at the horizon lean in like ancient trees given faces, pushing back against the encroaching ironworks cranes and smokestacks; a ferryman in a long coat steers a shallow boat across a mirror-thin brine channel that cuts through the salt like a silver scar, but his oar drags glowing echoes instead of water, trailing luminous rings that drift upward into the sky; at the center of the caravan city stands a Trojan horse reimagined as a brutalist concrete colossus with circus posters pasted on its flanks—its side door ajar, hinting at something alive inside; a death’s-head moth the size of a kite hovers close to the stone face, wings dusting the air with ash-gold pollen, and a victory wreath made of electrified laurel floats above the lovers like a fragile halo; rich, layered background details everywhere (tiny performers, cables, lanterns, salt crystals like stars, distant pines merging with scaffolding), soft unsettling dreamlight, moonrise haze, neon reflections trembling in the salt, frozen mid-mischief as if the whole scene is holding its breath.
