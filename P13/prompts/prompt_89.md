A faceless traveler in a patched ceremonial coat kneels on a cracked terrace of ancient stepped ruins repurposed as a firework rehearsal yard, offering a warm, wrapped gift to a small stray dog; as the dog sniffs it, the wrapping loosens into a flock of tiny thank‑you notes that whirl upward like birds, and the traveler’s empty hood briefly reveals a floating skull lit from within like a lantern, grinning softly; above them a sudden hailstorm falls—not ice, but translucent beads that refract the scene into multiple versions, and where the beads strike the stone they chip the world open, exposing thin seams of glowing code beneath the masonry as if reality is flaking like paint; in the bruised twilight sky an enormous all‑seeing eye watches gently, reflected in puddles and in the polished brass of fireworks stacked in crates; a weathered Faravahar emblem, half relief carving and half living kite, circles overhead on frayed strings tied to broken columns; scattered around the terraces are rehearsal props—chalk target marks, ladders, spools of fuse, paper masks with no faces, and a rusted trident planted upright like a signpost/umbrella catching the strange hail; distant fireworks are being tested silently, blooming as muted, powdery colors that illuminate carved inscriptions, creeping vines, and collapsed stairways filled with lanterns, feathers, and offerings; atmosphere dreamlike and slightly unsettling, soft rim light, drifting smoke and glittering hail, deep layered background with ruins descending into a busy, mysterious yard below; vertical composition, 2:3 aspect ratio.
