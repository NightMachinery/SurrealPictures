A young monarch in a slightly oversized crown stands halfway down a cathedral-like banquet hall grown from living wood, holding a tiny open music box like a lantern; from its spinning dancer spills a luminous “thread” that unspools through the air like silk, stitching together drifting memories—ghostly hands buttoning a coat, a warm bowl offered in winter, a bedtime story—each memory crystallized into softly weapon-like shapes (a spear of lullaby light, a shield made of embroidered care) that orbit protectively around them; shy kodama-like tree spirits peek from knots in the pillars and from fruit hanging like chandeliers, tugging the thread to guide it through the scene as if weaving fate; the banquet stretches into the distance like a nave, its long table set with tarnished gold plates and floating silverware that eats by itself, folding napkins into birds and conducting an invisible orchestra; under the table, shadowy grief pools like spilled ink, and in it drift tiny paper boats of condolences, beautiful and heavy; at the far end, behind a veil of steam and candle-smoke, an enormous cracked egg of polished marble rests on a nest of books and moss—its fissures glowing with dawn, hinting at a genesis about to hatch; soft, dreamlike light shafts through stained-glass leaves overhead, dust motes glittering, reflections rippling across the floor like shallow water, the mood playful but unsettling, a frozen moment of tender melancholy where protection, origin, and loss all share the same breath (vertical 2:3).
