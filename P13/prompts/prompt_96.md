A lone polar traveler in a patched coat kneels beside a gigantic baroque aquarium shaped like a gilded cathedral, half-buried in an ice-shelf labyrinth; inside the glass, miniature masked prisoners in formal attire steer a tiny boat between coral chandeliers and overturned teacups, slipping a key toward a hairline crack as if escaping a storybook jail. Above them, a stopped clock the size of a doorway is fused into the ice wall—its hands frozen at midnight—while thin cursed black worm-tendrils seep from the clockface, threading through the ice like roots and curling toward the aquarium’s gold filigree. The traveler offers a warm bundle of bread and bright fruit on a small cloth (a quiet gesture of gratitude), and the “food” becomes lantern-light: dozens of festival lanterns rise from the offering and drift into the tunnels, illuminating hidden passages and painting soft amber reflections across the glass. In the sky under vivid polar halos and aurora ribbons, the Simurgh glides like a living constellation, shedding feather-like sparks; a tall white crane stands sentinel on a mirror-smooth ice canal, and a phoenix made of glowing paper-lanterns briefly ignites, then folds back into calm, hovering above the maze like a signpost. Rich, layered background: carved ice archways, distant figures celebrating with lantern strings across crevasses, frost-covered banners, submerged city ruins visible through blue ice, and swirling snow that feels gentle yet ominous; dreamy soft light with unsettling shadows, deep perspective, high detail, surreal fairy-tale ambiguity, vertical 2:3 composition.
