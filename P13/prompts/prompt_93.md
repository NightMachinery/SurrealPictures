A towering Simurgh with ember-feathered wings descends into a cinder valley of smoking, translucent glass dunes, its talons gently lifting a life-sized marionette soldier whose wooden joints are cracking into living skin—one half of his face suddenly wrinkling into old age while the other remains boyish, as if a curse is choosing a future in real time; above him, the Simurgh’s shadow falls like a protective canopy while thin puppet-strings—origin unknown—still tug at his wrists and ankles, pulling him toward a many-headed hydra yoked to a harvest plow made of melted bayonets and polished ice, each hydra head wearing a different broken helmet like a crown; the hydra strains forward, coughing out steam and snow, carving furrows through ash where impossible crops sprout instantly: wheat made of glass beads, pomegranates glowing like coals, and white blossoms that freeze mid-bloom, while fat luminous grubs crawl across a gigantic fallen leaf used as a makeshift feast-table, chewing lace-like holes that resemble maps of vanished countries; in the layered background, shattered war banners are repurposed into quilts on refugee carts, scarecrows built from medals bow in prayer, and distant dunes reflect ghostly silhouettes of marching armies that dissolve into flocks of birds; the moment feels both ecstatic and ominously tender—abundance born from ruin—under a sky split between aurora-cold blue and wildfire orange, with drifting ash-snow, prismatic reflections in the glass sand, and a soft, storybook haze that hides as much as it reveals (vertical 2:3).
