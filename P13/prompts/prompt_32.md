Vertical 2:3 — In a vast funhouse-cathedral made of warped mirrors and softly tarnished gold, an unflustered Host in a ceremonial coat stands perfectly still on a checkerboard aisle, offering a small wrapped gift to a traveler who is inexplicably scaled wrong (a child-sized pilgrim carrying a door-sized lantern), while the surrounding mirrors refuse to reflect them directly and instead show different endings to the same fairy tale: an opened gilded cage releasing paper birds, a banquet set for no guests, and a distant shoreline where sea-witch tentacles curl like velvet drapery; at the center of the Host’s palm rests a seeing-stone shaped like a triangle with a hole through it, projecting a clean void of darkness that punches through reflections and reveals a living cypress tree growing indoors from a cracked mosaic font, its roots threading under pews filled with porcelain masks; far behind, an enormous Sunrise Gate stands ajar, spilling warm dawn light and floating dust into the cathedral, bending into ribbons as it passes through mirrors, creating calm, contented stillness with an unsettling sense that the gift is both a blessing and a key to escape.
