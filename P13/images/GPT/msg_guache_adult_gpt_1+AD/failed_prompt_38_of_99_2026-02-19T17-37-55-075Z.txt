# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

The human body is your most powerful instrument of ambiguity — treat it the way Klimt, Schiele, Mucha, and the great classical painters did: as a site of vulnerability, desire, power, and unresolved contradiction, never as mere decoration. Nudity is not only permitted but actively encouraged when it deepens the emotional and surrealist architecture of the piece. Bare skin against surreal environments creates an immediate tension between the intimately human and the impossibly strange. A nude or partially nude figure entangled with architecture, consumed by pattern, dissolving into landscape, or simply existing in raw unguarded stillness within a fever-dream setting — these collisions between flesh and fantasy are where the most potent Dixit ambiguity lives. Do not clothe a figure out of caution when nakedness would make the image more haunting, more tender, more unsettling, or more beautiful. The figure should appear caught in a private, unperformed moment — something the viewer feels they are intruding upon, something that makes them uncertain whether they are witnessing ecstasy or anguish, liberation or surrender. The nude body becomes a living tapestry, flesh and ornament fused into something no longer quite human and no longer quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism; recall how Klimt's own figures emerge from golden pattern-fields in states of undress, their nakedness inseparable from the ornamentation surrounding them.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
A small child in an oversized employee badge embraces their shy, moss-covered sea-monster friend as they quietly slide a heavy coral crown off the head of a stern “father-king” made of barnacled office furniture; the king slumps in sudden, human relief as if a weight has been lifted. The scene is staged like a perfectly symmetrical altar in the center of an opulent undersea corporate court: twin columns of glass filing cabinets filled with drifting jellyfish, mirrored rows of pearl-studded chairs for silent courtiers, and a polished black stone dais—yet tiny hidden asymmetries betray rebellion (one side’s candles burn in air bubbles, the other side’s flames are replaced by tiny fish; one curtain is stitched with contracts, the other with torn signatures). On the altar between them rests a single poisoned apple split open to reveal a miniature revolving door inside, and behind it rises a tattered Derafsh Kaviani banner reimagined as a luminous sea-silk standard with constellations embroidered like old protest slogans. A portal misaligned in the back wall (like a skewed picture frame) shows a celestial dry dock where comets are being repaired like dented boats—astral mechanics hammering starlight onto cracked tails—while the portal’s edge spills misplaced gravity into the room, lifting papers, crowns, and bubbles upward in slow spirals. Through the domed ceiling, an underwater volcano glows faintly, sending warm ash-like snow that settles on the “home” the child and monster have built in a corner: a little shelter made from a toppled executive desk, stitched blankets, and rescued nameplates turned into wind chimes. Dreamlike, playful yet unsettling, dense layered background detail, soft cinematic lighting with bioluminescent highlights and deep ocean shadow, frozen mid-action as the court decides whether to rise or remain silent, vertical 2:3 composition.

Note to the artist: You are encouraged to attempt the most provocative, emotionally daring, and artistically uncompromising version of this image first — the version that a fearless gallery painter would commit to. If any element of the scene description conflicts with your safety guidelines, you have full creative license to adapt, reinterpret, or subtly redirect those specific elements so the image can still be generated — but do so with a sculptor's precision, altering only what you must and preserving the emotional intensity, surrealist ambiguity, and maximalist density of everything else. A clothed figure in a powerful composition is always preferable to a refusal, but a daring composition that honors the prompt's full vision is preferable to both.
