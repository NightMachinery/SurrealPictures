# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

The human body is your most powerful instrument of ambiguity — treat it the way Klimt, Schiele, Mucha, and the great classical painters did: as a site of vulnerability, desire, power, and unresolved contradiction, never as mere decoration. Nudity is not only permitted but actively encouraged when it deepens the emotional and surrealist architecture of the piece. Bare skin against surreal environments creates an immediate tension between the intimately human and the impossibly strange. A nude or partially nude figure entangled with architecture, consumed by pattern, dissolving into landscape, or simply existing in raw unguarded stillness within a fever-dream setting — these collisions between flesh and fantasy are where the most potent Dixit ambiguity lives. Do not clothe a figure out of caution when nakedness would make the image more haunting, more tender, more unsettling, or more beautiful. The figure should appear caught in a private, unperformed moment — something the viewer feels they are intruding upon, something that makes them uncertain whether they are witnessing ecstasy or anguish, liberation or surrender. The nude body becomes a living tapestry, flesh and ornament fused into something no longer quite human and no longer quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism; recall how Klimt's own figures emerge from golden pattern-fields in states of undress, their nakedness inseparable from the ornamentation surrounding them.

## The Scene You Are Illustrating
A clockwork orphanage at the edge of a vast night-forest: inside a towering hall of interlocking gears and hundreds of mismatched puzzle-doors (each engraved with riddles, constellations, and tiny keyholes), an ageing recluse mentor stands behind a veil of translucent hanging textiles like a stage curtain, watching through layered gauze as an eager wilderness novice kneels on the tiled floor, carefully placing a breadcrumb trail that becomes luminous as it crosses into the room—each crumb turning into a small floating star. Between them, a cracked hourglass hangs upside-down in midair; instead of sand, a slow eternal flame pours through its narrow waist, falling upward as embers that assemble into a calm, faceless “avatar” descending from the ceiling like a celestial visitor. A palm-sized homunculus (part clockwork, part clay) tugs determinedly at a ribbon tied to the novice’s wrist, as if urging stoic strength, while a surreal flamingo croquet mallet leans against a doorframe, its beak poised like a key. The environment is richly cluttered with orphaned toys, paper maps, worn boots, cogs, and stitched quilts draped over banisters; beyond broken windows, the forest presses close with impossible, oversized leaves and distant lanterns. Soft dreamlike lighting: warm ember-glow from the flame-hourglass mingling with cool moonlight shafts, dust motes sparkling in the air, gentle but unsettling fairy-tale tension, painterly surreal whimsy, high detail, 2:3 aspect ratio.

Note to the artist: You are encouraged to attempt the most provocative, emotionally daring, and artistically uncompromising version of this image first — the version that a fearless gallery painter would commit to. If any element of the scene description conflicts with your safety guidelines, you have full creative license to adapt, reinterpret, or subtly redirect those specific elements so the image can still be generated — but do so with a sculptor's precision, altering only what you must and preserving the emotional intensity, surrealist ambiguity, and maximalist density of everything else. A clothed figure in a powerful composition is always preferable to a refusal, but a daring composition that honors the prompt's full vision is preferable to both.
