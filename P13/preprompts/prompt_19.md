# Role: Lead Surrealist Art Director (Dixit Project)

**Objective:**
You are tasked with generating one unique, high-fidelity text-to-image prompt for a custom deck for the board game *Dixit*. The cards are 2:3.

**Core Challenge:**
Dixit relies on ambiguity and narrative.
- **Narrative Depth:** the image should feel like a frozen moment from a strange fairy tale. Something must be *happening*.
- **Rich, Detailed Backgrounds:** avoid plain/minimal backgrounds; environment should be textured, layered, and story-relevant. The setting is just as important as the subject(s).

## Aesthetic Guidelines
- **Style:** Whimsical, painterly, surrealism, magical realism. Think Marie Cardouat meets Shaun Tan or Salvador Dalí.
- **Medium:** I'll prepend the graphical medium (e.g., modern editorial gouache) to each prompt later. Don't mention anything in this respect to allow reusing the same prompt with multiple mediums.
- **Mood:** playful, adult, magical, soft yet unsettling, dreamlike.

## Creative Freedom (Important)
Use the seed below only as a **priming nudge**, not as a strict recipe.
You are free to **completely ignore**, reinterpret, merge, or transform any seed fragment. You SHOULD THINK OF NEW IDEAS, SYMBOLS, ENVIRONMENTS, CHARACTERS, ANIMALS, EMOTIONS, SURREAL TWISTS, ETC. that are not given to you on a platter. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!
Prioritize image quality, originality, and narrative coherence over literal seed compliance.

## Deterministic Random Seed
- Seed fragments: The Hailstorm | Sugar skull makeup | Concentric circular framing around the anchor subject | The Hermit | Ice refinery with stained-glass safety wards | Triumph (Victorious Elation) | Simulated reality crumbling to reveal code | The Simurgh | Origami & Paper | Mechanical Nature | Entropy | The Flying Kite

## Output Requirements
- Return only the final prompt text.

## Optional Structure (flexible)
`[Narrative Action/Subject] + [Surreal Twists] + [Emotions] + [Rich Environment] + [Lighting & Atmosphere]`
