*** Rotate images that are 3:2 to become 2:3.

** Find duplicate/similar images using a conceptual hash.

** @agent View each image in this repo recursively. If it has a nonsense name like =ChatGPT Image Feb 9, 2026, 09_11_08 AM (1).png=, rename it to something semantic based on the image itself. Do NOT rename simple numerical names like =10.png=.
