**Aspect ratio 2:3** — Bird’s-eye diorama view, like a meticulously built miniature stage-map of a **traveling circus caravan city** jammed shoulder-to-shoulder on blinding white **salt flats** (no empty horizon anywhere; every corner crowded with wagons, tents, rope bridges, cages, bunting, lantern strings, tarot booths, mirror carts, stacked trunks, scattered masks, silk gloves, feathers, broken toys, tiny altars, spilled confetti that reads like snow). The entire world is caught in a **Frozen Dream**: an impossible instant where **gravity has reversed**—caravans, horses, performers, chairs, ladders, salt-crystals, ribbons, coins, and droplets of tea are all “falling” upward toward a second upside-down city that hovers above, perfectly aligned like a cruel reflection; shadows disagree, and some objects hang mid-transfer between the two gravities as if time itself hesitated. At the center, a **maypole** rises from a cracked salt-rose, but its ribbons do not spiral downward; they stream outward in straight, tensioned lines like ligaments, lacing the whole city together—binding, mending, choking, comforting—tying to wrists, wagon axles, tent peaks, and the ankles of upside-down acrobats, creating a dense web that can be read as either embrace or entrapment. Near it, physically present and unmissable: a colossal **stopped clock** (pocket-watch scale, face exposed, innards visible), embedded half in salt and half in air, hands frozen at an ambiguous hour; its gears have become tiny balconies where miniature scenes cluster—whispering, bargaining, praying, laughing, weeping—none readable as a single story. In the thick of this, two mythic **ninja** figures (timeless, not generic; gender-ambiguous, human-adjacent) occupy the emotional anchor: one kneels on “ground” that is also “ceiling,” posture heavy with restraint, offering their own mask forward with both hands as if surrendering identity; the other hovers just above, caught between gravities, reaching not to take the mask but to gently **untie a ribbon** from the first ninja’s throat—an act that could be rescue, mercy, or betrayal. A third presence—an animalistic ninja (fox-moth hybrid, delicate antennae, silent authority)—stands aside holding a small lantern that lights nothing physically, only **reveals** hidden patterning like absolution. The theme is **forgiveness / grace** expressed only through visual metaphor: knots becoming bows, blades sheathed in flowers, salt turning to lace, a torn banner stitched midair, a spilled cup that rises back into wholeness, a wound that is also an embroidery hoop, mercy offered as a thread pulled through a needle; everywhere, tiny narrative clusters echo the central gesture without explaining it. **Whimsy** saturates the mood: playful absurdity in candy-glow lantern light, pastel-gold color grade, odd gentle humor in background vignettes (a lion politely reading a confession; a tightrope walker serving tea upside down; clowns performing surgery on a marionette heart; a fortune-teller crying glitter), yet the tenderness carries adult undertones of longing, shame, relief, and dread. **Global rendering rule (non-negotiable):** every visible surface—skin, hair, fabric, metal, wood, salt, sky—covered in hyper-intricate pattern skins (brocade, damask, stained glass, circuitry, thorn filigree, starfields, lacework, woodgrain), but these patterns remain **perfectly flat and static like collage decals**: they do **not** warp, bend, stretch, or follow curvature or perspective even as the 3D forms twist and recede, creating a hypnotic paradox everywhere, especially on any bare skin (tasteful artistic nudity only, iconic not explicit). Style: Klimt gilded ornament meets Schiele vulnerability meets Mucha linework with classical painterly realism; maximalist, razor-sharp microdetail, gallery-quality illustration, no text, no watermark, no empty space, ambiguity preserved—one image that can be read as blessing, punishment, reunion, confession, or farewell.
