Vertical 2:3 gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit, polysemic Rorschach), a “Frozen Dream” frame: inside a vast gilded banquet nave that feels half-cathedral, half-palace dining hall, every inch crowded—arched ribs plated in gold leaf, stained-glass shadows, brocade banners, lacquered tables like altars, chandeliers made of cut crystal teeth, velvet drapery turning into roots; thousands of pieces of silverware float as if gravity forgot them (forks like constellations, knives like tiny moons, spoons reflecting memories), swirling around two mythic Lovers at the center who are not quite human: one figure a tall androgynous marble-golem with a tender cracked face, the other a luminous bird-saint echoing the Simurgh (peacock–phoenix hybrid) but with human hands; they lean toward each other with unbearable intimacy yet a hairline distance remains, fingertips almost touching over the table’s edge—posture communicating devotion and shame simultaneously, ecstasy held back by etiquette; their bodies are partially nude in an artistic, vulnerable way (no explicit sex), draped in fragmented finery (torn opera gloves, ceremonial sash, pearl threads) and the entire world obeys a global paradox rule: EVERY surface—skin, feathers, metal, bread, wine, stone, sky glimpsed through clerestory—covered in intricate flat decorative skins (Klimt gold mosaics, Schiele nervous line, Mucha filigree, damask, lacework, circuitry, thorn arabesques, starfields, woodgrain, illuminated-manuscript borders) that remain perfectly planar and static like collage cutouts, NEVER bending or following form, while the underlying 3D anatomy and architecture twist and recede normally, creating hypnotic dissonance; the core theme is Memory/Nostalgia made literal and displaced: instead of food, platters carry small impossible “relics of scenes” (a child’s wet footprint, a perfume bottle uncorking a sunrise, a cinema ticket bleeding ocean), and the nave itself exhales faint ghost-images of earlier banquets—before-and-after echoes layered in one tableau (transparent duplicate hands mid-reach, multiple positions of a turning head, a wineglass simultaneously unbroken and shattered, a chair both occupied and empty), like time folded into stained glass; include an hourglass physically present and central but broken open, its sand suspended and drifting through the air to become glittering pollen that clings to faces and cutlery, each grain containing a miniature remembered room; include Achilles’ heel as a visual totem: one Lover’s heel is visibly vulnerable—wrapped in a delicate bandage of gold thread that’s unraveling, or a small arrow-shaped clasp lodged near the heel—quietly signaling the single point of weakness amid grandeur; the Simurgh motif appears both as the bird-lover and as a carved, many-winged relief in the apse whose feathers shed luminous fragments into the hall; lighting and color-grade embody blinding joy + aching distance at once: euphoric overexposed halo from high clerestory windows, prismatic flares and warm golds, but with a cool blue loneliness pooling in the far aisles and under tables; fill foreground/midground/background with dense micro-narratives that refuse a single story (floating crumbs as tiny planets, napkins as folded letters, mirrors that show different ages of the Lovers, grapes that are beads, pearls that are seeds, a procession of empty masks on serving trays, moths made of sheet music), intricate detail in every corner, no empty space, painterly illustration (not photo), ultra-detailed linework + gilded ornamental finish, no text, no watermark, no modern UI elements.
