Ultra‑wide 14mm viewpoint from knee‑height inside a dense dune city, edges of the world curving like a fisheye dream; the whole scene staged as a paper‑theater diorama with visible stacked layers, cutout tabs, torn collage borders, inset mosaics and diptych-like side panels, yet rendered with gallery‑grade painterly finish (Klimt gilded ornament + Schiele vulnerability + Mucha linework + classical chiaroscuro). In the crowded foreground, two mythic protagonists pause mid‑ritual: an androgynous “Fool” with tender, bewildered eyes and a half‑smile, their body partly nude like a living tapestry, and a “Friend” who is not quite human—an intimate companion formed from soft sculpture (velvet-sandstone skin, stitched seams, pillowy joints) gently steadying the Fool by the wrists as if guiding a repeating vow; their closeness reads as protection or possession depending on the viewer. Physics is loudly broken by **soft sculpture**: towers slump like draped fabric, arches buckle like wet clay, staircases pour downward in slow folds, and floating balconies sag in midair—everything frozen at the instant before collapse, yet perfectly still. The ritual/cycle theme is everywhere without telling a story: circular processions of tiny masked figures loop on different planes like paper cutouts; a braided ribbon road forms a closed ring around the pair; hourglass sand runs upward; hands exchange the same object in repeating friezes; footprints spiral and return to the start; a serpent of prayer beads bites its own tail across the skyline. Midground architecture is dominated by a **Sunrise Gate**—a monumental dawn‑shaped portal cut into layered façades, glowing with soft rose-gold light; above it hovers an ambiguous **Halo** (part icon, part eclipse, part wedding ring) casting gentle tenderness rather than holiness. The **Derafsh Kaviani** is physically present as a heavy, jeweled banner standard held between Fool and Friend (or tethering them), its tassels and gems scattering into the air as suspended debris: threads, petals, tiny mirrors, calligraphic scraps, moth wings, salt crystals, splinters of stained glass, drifting sand that looks like glitter. Giant woven canopies shelter the city like upside‑down baskets and spiderweb looms, crowded with hanging lamps, bones, bells, fruit, talismans, puppets, and folded letters; every corner contains miniature scenes that contradict each other (a lullaby tableau, a funeral offering, a coronation gesture, a shy embrace, a quiet theft), none resolving into a single narrative. **Global rendering rule (non‑negotiable):** every visible surface—skin, hair, cloth, stone, sky, water, metal, banners, shadows—must be covered in intricate flat decorative pattern layers (brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry, lace, woodgrain, starfields, stained glass), and these patterns must remain perfectly planar and unmoving like collage paper or window decals: they must NOT warp, stretch, bend, or follow the 3D curvature/perspective of the forms beneath, even as the volumetric forms twist and recede, creating a hypnotic paradox of flat ornament over sculptural depth. Color grade: tender dawn—muted gold leaf, blush, lapis, smoke-violet; soft rim light and gentle bloom, intimate and aching rather than triumphant. Hyper-detailed, no empty space, no readable text, no watermark; emotionally polysemic, dream-familiar, unsettlingly kind. --ar 2:3
