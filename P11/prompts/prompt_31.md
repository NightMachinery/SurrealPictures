Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration for an adult Dixit card: inside a baroque kitchen-cathedral that feels both intimate and impossibly vast, a mythic **Chef** and a mythic **Dreamer** face one another in perfect stillness—**the Chef** tall, ritualistic, half-human/half-stove (ribcage like an open oven, calm hands in white gloves), wearing an apron patterned like a stained-glass altarpiece; **the Dreamer** seated and slightly reclining on a banquet table as if on a chaise, serene and vulnerable, eyes closed, body nude-but-non-explicit and icon-like, their skin covered in flat ornamental panels (brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry) that do **not** follow anatomy, like collage wallpaper laid over flesh. The Chef gently lifts a spoon toward the Dreamer’s lips, but the spoon holds not soup—an entire tiny version of the same scene; within that miniature, another smaller scene; and so on, **infinite recursion** clearly visible as nested dioramas spiraling inward, each repeating the same frozen gesture with microscopic fidelity. The room itself also recurses: archways frame smaller archways; a door opens into the same kitchen at a different scale; a mirror reflects the tableau but the reflection contains another mirror, creating a calm, vertiginous “forever.” The **Tower of Babel** is physically present as a teetering spiral ziggurat made of stacked plates, cookbooks, tongues of brick, and glazed tiles, rising through the midground; a living **Cypress of Kashmar** grows through the architecture like a sacred column, its branches forming latticed vaulting; a soft **halo** floats between Chef and Dreamer like a shared object (not attached to either), luminous and weightless, casting gentle gold light that grades the entire scene into contented, velvety stillness (warm ambers, muted jade, milk-white highlights, no harsh drama). Make the grotesque/uncanny pervasive but quiet: ingredients are ambiguous (pearls that resemble teeth, pomegranate seeds like rubies, onions like planets, bread scored like fingerprints), cherub-like kitchen tools with too-human joints, serene masks on hanging ladles, a curtain of lace that looks like skin, yet everything feels tender, domesticated, and calm. **Crowd every corner**: floating flour motes frozen midair, suspended droplets of oil like tiny halos, drifting recipe slips, mosaic crumbs, small birds made of folded napkins, cutlery forming constellations, tiled floor packed with symbolic debris (tiny staircases, broken icons, stitched mouths, miniature ladders). **Global rendering rule:** every visible surface—skin, hair, metal, wood, stone, steam, sky through the windows, water in bowls—must be covered edge-to-edge with intricate flat patterns (Klimt-like gold leaf, Mucha ornament, stained-glass geometry, woodgrain, starfields, lace, etched circuitry), and these pattern layers must remain perfectly flat and unwarped against the 3D forms beneath, creating a hypnotic paradox. Composition: close enough to read micro-details yet deep enough to show the Babel-tower, the Cypress-column, and recursive space; no empty negative space; no text; no modern logos; no explicit sex act—only sacred, unsettling intimacy rendered with exquisite, crowded detail.
