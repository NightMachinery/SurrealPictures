Aspect ratio 2:3 (vertical). “The Frozen Dream” — a crowded, gallery-quality surrealist illustration in the emotional lineage of Klimt/Schiele/Mucha (ornamental symbolist Art Nouveau + anxious expressionist anatomy), rendered with ruthless micro-detail, gold-leaf glints, etched linework, stained-glass luminosity, and a brave dawn color-grade (ultramarine night breaking into warm amber; fearless, forward-driving light). Viewpoint: the viewer stands inside a gravity-defying astronomy school, looking upward through a wide panoramic vertical stack of spatial layers—an impossible atrium of floating classrooms, inverted observatories, spiraling staircases that become chalk-lines, suspended blackboards, drifting orreries, lenses, sextants, hourglasses, star-maps, quills, torn lecture notes, moth scales, incense smoke, and slow-motion debris frozen mid-arc; no empty horizons, every corner crowded with meaningful clutter and half-readable pseudo-diagrams of constellations and eclipses.

Radial composition: the entire architecture explodes outward like a mandala from a single symbol-core at the center—an ornate shared cup held between two mythic presences: a colossal Shah (ancient, tender, terrifyingly calm) kneels as if he is also part-throne, part-archway, his robe a palace of brocade and courtly insignia; opposite him, an Explorer advances without hesitation, boots on a floating desk as if stepping into confession, their body anatomically impossible (too many joints, a second ribcage opening like a cabinet of tiny star-rooms, a spine that unrolls into a navigational map), yet posed with quiet dignity. Their interaction is intimate but ambiguous: the Shah’s vast hand steadies the cup while the Explorer tilts it; a single suspended spill becomes the metaphor of forgiveness/grace—liquid light falling upward and outward into the school’s physics, transforming fractures into bridges, turning broken chalk into new constellations, sealing old wounds in the stone with luminous “kintsugi” seams, and softening the severest angles of the place into habitable curves, as if mercy is rewriting gravity.

The Death’s-head moth is physically present and unmistakable: enormous, serene, and watchful, perched at the symbol-core or unfurled as a living vault above it; its skull-mark reads as both omen and guardian, wings patterned like star-charts and cathedral lace. The Tower of Babel is integrated as architecture: a spiraling vertical tower assembled from stacked books, lecterns, tongues of bells, and blackboards layered with overlapping alphabets and astronomical notations (pseudo-script, no clean readable text), the tower splitting into multiple contradictory vanishing points as it rises through the stacked classrooms—its presence both ambition and fracture, yet bathed in the same forgiving light from the cup.

GLOBAL RENDERING LAW (must be obeyed everywhere): every single surface—skin, hair, stone, brass, cloth, glass, smoke, water, sky—covered edge-to-edge in intricate pattern (damask, brocade, circuitry filigree, thorn lattice, woodgrain, starfields, lace, mosaic, illuminated-manuscript borders); on nude/near-nude bodies the effect is striking: living tapestry flesh. Crucially, these patterns remain perfectly flat and static like rigid collage cutouts locked to the picture plane: they do NOT warp, bend, foreshorten, or follow form curvature; the 3D forms underneath can twist, recede, and contort, but the “pattern skins” stay un-deformed, creating a hypnotic paradox between volumetric anatomy and flat ornament across the entire scene.

Ambiguity mandate: no single story—express simultaneously longing, shame, tenderness, grief, and ecstatic relief; the moment is mid-event yet frozen (chalk dust hanging, pages halted mid-flutter, an orrery shattered but still orbiting). Hyper-detailed occlusion and layered partitions; foreground hands/tools/notes partially block the protagonists; background classrooms teem with silent figures, masks, and instruments that could be students, ghosts, or memories. No minimalism, no blank space, no straightforward narrative, no modern UI, no photoreal look—pure painterly surrealist illustration, museum-grade, emotionally intelligent, paradox-forward.
