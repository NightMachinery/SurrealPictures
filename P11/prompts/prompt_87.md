Vertical 2:3 gallery-grade surrealist illustration, “Frozen Dream” freeze-frame inside a floating customs office for dream travelers—an impossible baroque/art-nouveau bureaucratic cathedral drifting in a black-green dawn fog, packed edge-to-edge with desks, hanging lamps, brass scanners, ladders, velvet ropes, queues of masked figures, floating luggage, broken hourglasses, moths, feathers, keys, medical vials, coins, wax seals, torn maps, and passport-stamps that leave afterimage trails in the air; at the center stands a mythic dyad fused by tension and care: a tender Healer and a sovereign Shah—neither fully human, both timeless—facing each other as if mid-judgment and mid-blessing, their bodies subtly nude in a classical, vulnerable way (no erotic posing), one hand steadying the other’s wrist while the other hand hovers over an opened chest-like suitcase that is also a womb-like portal; between them a single shared cup is suspended as if being offered and refused at once, its liquid frozen mid-pour into two directions, and above their joined hands the scales of justice hang from an architectural archway, but the pans are displaced through different portals so they balance across different rooms; the defining impossibility is PORTAL DISPLACEMENT made blatant: doorframes open onto the wrong distances and wrong gravities—half a desk continues into a doorway that exits as a staircase on the ceiling, a traveler’s shadow steps out of a stamp-pad while their body steps out of a filing cabinet, a corridor intersects itself like folded paper, and a wall-sized customs window reveals not outside but a close-up interior of someone’s eye like a checkpoint universe being born; the theme of ORIGIN/GENESIS manifests as the building itself “creating” reality via clerical rituals—newborn constellations drip from ink wells, rib-like columns bud into fresh doors, and the air is full of embryonic forms made of paperwork and skin, as if existence is being authored, stamped, and inspected; integrate a Trojan Horse physically as contraband-architecture: a wooden horse used as the luggage scanner/inspection shrine, its belly open with glowing compartments, and tiny figures mid-climb into it with motion-blur echoes frozen behind them; encode time with illustrated motion-blur trails and sequential ghost-frames (hands repeated, stamps repeated, footsteps repeated) while everything remains perfectly still; oppressive, creeping-unease lighting—sickly gold leaf highlights on cold teal/umber shadows, claustrophobic haze, anxious negative space avoided by dense detail in every corner; ABSOLUTE GLOBAL RENDER RULE: every visible surface (skin, hair, cloth, wood, stone, glass, fog, water, metal) is covered in intricate decorative patterns—brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained-glass leadwork, lace, starfields—yet these pattern “skins” must remain perfectly flat, static, and non-perspectival like collage decals that do NOT warp, bend, or follow the 3D curvature beneath them, creating a hypnotic paradox of planar ornament over volumetric forms; style cues: Klimt gold-and-ornament density + Schiele vulnerability and tension + Mucha line elegance + classical painterly anatomy, ultra-detailed, no empty horizons, no legible text, no modern photo look, emotionally ambiguous and polysemic.
