Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (Klimt × Schiele × Mucha, symbolist art nouveau, luminous oil-and-gouache realism with razor-fine linework): inside a **neon-lit train depot** so crowded it feels claustrophobically tender—every inch packed with **abandoned luggage stacked into altar-like shrines** (suitcases, trunks, violin cases, hatboxes) tied with ribbons, rosaries of baggage tags, little votive bulbs, wilted bouquets, ticket stubs like prayers; the scene is a single **frozen dream-frame** mid-miracle. Center foreground: **two mythic “children”** (timeless, ambiguous species—half porcelain, half animal, half human; large solemn eyes; small bodies carrying impossible weight) facing each other with intimate social tension: one child’s posture is guarded and ashamed, the other leans forward with a steady **open hand** extended—an offering that could be forgiveness, farewell, or invitation; between their hands hangs a suspended droplet of **solid glass** shaped like a tear that refuses to fall. The depot’s physics is broken by **SOLID LIQUIDITY**: the steel rails **flow like molten stone** in slow curls yet remain rigid, platform tiles pour upward like a waterfall made of terrazzo, and “puddles” of marble stand upright as transparent slabs; a halted train in the background is mid-dissolve into ribbon-like metal that streams without motion. The **broken crown** appears as a fractured diadem altar—its shards orbiting a suitcase shrine like halted shrapnel, each shard reflecting warm neon; a **halo** is present as a cracked ring of station light hovering behind/around the children (simultaneously saintly and industrial, like a bent fluorescent aureole). Compassionate warmth + whimsy: soft golden-pink key light mixed with cyan/magenta neon rim light, dust motes and confetti-like ticket fragments frozen in the air, gentle steam that looks like lace; corners packed with odd tenderness—tiny paper birds folded from schedules, a lost glove offering a second “hand,” a vending machine dispensing tiny stars, clocks with unreadable hands, silhouettes of passengers made of patterned wallpaper. **Global rendering paradox rule (mandatory):** every surface—skin, hair, stone, water, metal, sky, glass—covered in hyper-intricate ornament (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained-glass lattices, woodgrain, starfields, lacework), and **these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static like collage cutouts**—they do **not** warp, bend, stretch, or follow the 3D curvature/perspective of the forms beneath; the underlying volumes can twist and recede normally while the “pattern-skins” stay locked to the picture plane, creating hypnotic contradiction. Ultra-dense foreground/midground/background storytelling without a single readable narrative; emotionally adult, vulnerable, paradoxical, intimate; no empty space; no text, no watermark.
