2:3 vertical, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (Viennese Secession / Art Nouveau + classical oil glazing + gold leaf accents), a “frozen dream” frame locked in mid-transformation: at a steep Dutch angle with cascading diagonals, an immense feast table slices the scene from lower-left foreground to upper-right distance like a tilted altar, crowded with impossible still-life abundance—pears half-transmuted into alabaster, bread crusts turning to mother-of-pearl, crystal goblets containing a captured tide, salt piled like snowdrifts, candles whose flames have solidified into glass moths—while above and behind it rises a colossal “Gate of All Nations,” an archway built from layered doorframes and mosaic borders suggesting many cultures (ornamental scripts and motifs implied but not readable), its threshold holding a blinding white radiance that feels holy and unbearably joyful. In the intimate center foreground, two Oracles interact as if sharing a secret: a tall, androgynous, partially nude figure with the stillness of an icon and a second nonhuman oracle (seraphic, animal-headed, or masked, tender and watchful) press close, foreheads nearly touching, hands interlaced around a sealed, translucent reliquary—inside it, innocence/purity is literally contained as a milk-white light that is transmuting into fragile objects (porcelain tears, pearl embryos, sugar feathers, tiny doves made of wax) suspended mid-swirling, as if time stopped while matter decided what it should become. A wilting bouquet is present as a key to the puzzle—clutched between them or pinned like a wound—its petals browning yet shedding luminous pollen that drifts through the air as fine debris, mixing with floating cutlery, torn lace, broken mirror shards, and small bells; in the corners, secondary paradoxes crowd every inch: a lace curtain pouring into a basin like water, a violin case blooming thorns, a door key trapped inside a soap bubble, a childlike paper crown weighed down by lead, a moth-wing map folded into a heart. **Global rendering rule (crucial): every visible surface without exception—skin, hair, stone, sky, glass, food, cloth, water, metal—must be densely covered in intricate flat pattern skins (brocade, damask, stained-glass leadwork, circuitry filigree, thorn arabesques, starfields, woodgrain, lace); these patterns remain perfectly planar and static like screen-printed collage layers and must NOT warp, bend, or follow the 3D curvature beneath them, creating a hypnotic paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form.** Lighting and color grade: candle-warm closeness around the Oracles (whispered intimacy, soft golds and flushed ambers) pierced by an overexposed, euphoric white beam from the Gate (ecstatic glare, prismatic bloom), deep shadows packed with detail, zero empty space, maximal ornament, no text, no watermark, no single readable narrative—only polysemic symbols inviting contradictory adult emotions (tenderness, longing, shame, awe, quiet dread).
