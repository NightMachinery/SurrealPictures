A vertical 2:3 gallery illustration in the spirit of Klimt + Schiele linework + Mucha ornament, rendered like a jeweled icon and a private dream: inside a **coral canyon choked with pearl staircases** (no empty horizon), a mythic couple dominates the frame—the **Shah**, tall and severe, crowned with antlered coral and a halo of hammered gold, and the **Beloved**, androgynous and tender, half-nude and half-robed in translucent sea-silk—leaning toward each other as if mid-coronation / mid-confession / mid-farewell; their hands meet around a single heirloom pearl that seems to contain an entire childhood, a throne room, and a funeral all at once (inheritance as a burden and a kiss). The canyon itself behaves like ancestry made architecture: embedded in the coral walls are cameo-like faces, empty reliquary niches, cracked wedding rings, tiny mirrored rooms, and fossilized handprints reaching outward; pearl staircases spiral everywhere, some ascending into nothing, some descending into the couple’s bodies, implying a lineage ladder that is both escape and trap. The defining impossible event is **fluid solidity**: seawater hangs in midair as perfectly faceted stone; coral flows like poured silk yet freezes into sharp marble folds; a “waterfall” is a suspended curtain of glass bricks; bubbles are heavy as cannonballs; ripples are carved like bas-relief—everything caught in a single frozen instant of ecstatic impact. The **Derafsh Kaviani** is physically present as the Shah’s banner and also as part of the canyon’s spine: a legendary, jewel-studded standard of stitched hides and gold plates that unfurls through the scene like a frozen wave, its tassels turning into pearl stair treads; its presence should feel like inherited legitimacy and inherited guilt. The **Cerberus** is present as a sentinel made of living coral and mother-of-pearl at the foot of a staircase that leads directly into the couple—three heads with different expressions (rapture, hunger, sorrow), each mouth holding a different relic (a key, a veil, a broken crown), watching like a family tradition that never sleeps. **Euphoria (blinding joy)** is the atmosphere: radiant, overexposed sunburst shafts refracting through “stone-water,” prismatic caustics, champagne highlights, luminous turquoises, hot golds, and opal pinks—joy so bright it feels like peril; the entire frame should glitter with celebratory debris (petals, salt crystals, tiny beads, moth-wings, shell shards, miniature coins) suspended in the frozen medium. **Global rendering law (must be obvious everywhere):** every surface—skin, hair, eyes, fabric, coral, pearls, water, sky—covered with hyper-intricate patterns (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained-glass leadwork, woodgrain, starfields, lace), but these patterns remain **perfectly flat and unwarped**, like screen-printed collage skins that ignore the 3D curvature beneath; the forms can twist and recede, yet the ornament stays locked like a separate decorative dimension. Crowd foreground/midground/background with symbolic micro-scenes in the corners (tiny inheritances being passed, refused, stolen, blessed; miniature staircases inside shells; mirrored genealogies), maintaining polysemy and emotional contradiction; no text, no modern logos, no explicit sex, no gore; razor-sharp detail, painterly finish, high dynamic range, static “frozen dream” action implied without motion blur.
