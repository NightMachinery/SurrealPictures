**Aspect ratio 2:3 (vertical).** A crowded, gallery-quality surrealist illustration in the spirit of Klimt + Schiele linework + Mucha ornament + classical oil glazing: inside a **dune city** packed with terraces, stairwells, minarets, market alcoves, and hanging bridges, all **sheltered beneath colossal woven canopies** (basketry the size of cathedrals) that droop like protective ribs; the entire city is composed around **obsessive balance / symmetry**—paired arches, mirrored balconies, twin staircases, doubled shadows—yet every “mirror” is slightly wrong, as if the world is trying (and failing) to stay rational. In the center foreground, two mythic protagonists interact: **the Prisoner** (androgynous, near-nude, icon-like body held upright by delicate shackles and ribbon-thin restraints that feel ceremonial rather than violent; gaze distant, surrendered, tenderly defiant) and **the Rationalist** (not quite human: a calm, faceless cartographer-priest with a brass compass, ink-stained gloves, and a surgeon’s poise; posture measured, almost compassionate), both posed as if weighing each other on an invisible scale—one hand of the Rationalist “adjusting” the Prisoner’s restraints like tuning a string, the other hand holding a plumb line that aligns with the city’s central axis. The defining impossible event: **Musical Materialization** frozen mid-bloom—sound has become matter—visible vibrations congeal into physical architecture: crystalline staff lines span streets like bridges; notes erupt from throats, horns, and cracked stone as tangible black pearls; a choir of suspended, translucent chords forms a haloed lattice above the pair; shattered percussion skins become floating moons; a silent chord-smash is paused in the air as splintered harp-strings and glass clefs, raining upward instead of down. Interwoven into the scene as totems: a lavish **Feast Table** runs diagonally through the composition like an altar and a street at once, overloaded with impossible “food” that is also instrument—figs that are tiny bellows, goblets that pour humming light, loaves crusted with miniature keys—its legs rooted into dunes like tree trunks; a **Broken Crown** (split, ceremonial, too heavy) rests off-center on the Prisoner’s shoulder or on a tilted platter, its fragments orbiting like thoughts; a luminous **Cornucopia** is lodged in a wall niche, spilling an ecstatic torrent of pomegranates, teeth-like pearls, ribbons, and solidified musical notes that cascade into the crowd and become stepping-stones. **Atmosphere: transcendent ecstasy**—opalescent golds, incense pinks, turquoise shadow, radiant backlight as if dawn and stage-spotlight are the same phenomenon; dust motes glitter like sanctified confetti; the air is dense with drifting scraps of lace, torn sheet music, feathers, sand, and tiny suspended utensils, all frozen mid-turbulence. **Global rendering rule (crucial): every surface is filled edge-to-edge with intricate patternwork—brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lace—especially on skin; these pattern “skins” remain perfectly flat, static, and collage-like, NEVER warping or following curvature, even as the underlying forms twist in 3D, creating a constant paradox of flat ornament on volumetric bodies, dunes, and architecture.** Foreground packed with intimate details (rings, measuring tools, crumbs, petals, broken tiles, tiny balances), midground crowded with ambiguous onlookers and masked vendors under the canopies, background dense with layered rooftops and mirrored towers dissolving into patterned haze—no empty sky, no clean horizon, no readable single story; high detail, sharp focal hierarchy, painterly micro-textures, surreal symbolism, emotionally intelligent ambiguity; no text, no watermark.
