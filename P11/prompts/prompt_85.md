**Aspect ratio 2:3 (vertical).** A crowded, gallery-quality surrealist illustration in the lineage of Klimt + Schiele linework + Mucha ornament + classical oil glazing, a “Frozen Dream” frame at a border checkpoint where **winter and late-summer collide**: on the left, brittle frost, salt-stained snowdrifts, bare black branches and paper-thin ice; on the right, humid heat haze, overripe pomegranates, pollen, and heavy blossoms—both seasons occupying the same architecture like incompatible passports stamped onto one wall. The checkpoint itself is a living character: an ornate customs archway made of tarnished brass, bone-white marble, and velvet curtains, crammed with turnstiles, inspection tables, dangling keys, stamped documents, broken suitcases, feathers, coins, prayer beads, wilted bouquets, bandages, love letters, and contraband relics; every inch of foreground/midground/background packed with symbolic debris and watchful silhouettes in booths and windows, never a clean horizon.

At center, the mythic **Widow & the Shah** hover in an impossible **levitation**: the Widow is a tall, androgynous, veiled figure whose posture mixes grief and authority—one hand offering, one hand refusing—her veil layered like funeral lace and hospital gauze, her body partially nude but rendered as sacred vulnerability; the Shah is regal and exhausted, a crowned figure with a ceremonial sash and courtly bearing, leaning toward her with a tenderness that looks illegal. Their interaction is intimate but unreadable: their fingertips nearly meet across an invisible border line that cuts through the air; the space between them glows as if warmed by compassion, as if the act of mercy itself is contraband. The Shah bears **Zahhak’s shoulder serpents**—two pale, intelligent snakes emerging from his shoulders like living epaulettes, not attacking but resting with unsettling devotion, their eyes turned toward the Widow’s offered hand.

The **Stopped Clock** is built into the checkpoint—an enormous, cracked clockface fused to the arch like a judge’s seal, hands frozen at an ambiguous hour; smaller pocket-watches float around it like metal snowflakes. A single **Glass Slipper** appears impossibly present and consequential—half-evidence, half-relic—caught midair like it has just fallen (or been surrendered), reflecting both seasons at once; its interior contains a tiny border stamp, a hair, or a dried petal that could change the entire story depending on the viewer. Everything is suspended: snow, petals, ash, stamps, keys, a spilled cup of tea, a crown pin, a torn photograph—motion implied, time arrested.

**Lighting / emotion:** compassionate, healing warmth: a soft amber-gold illumination (like candlelight filtered through honeyed stained glass) wraps the central figures, gently pushing back the cold blues and feverish greens of the opposing seasons; the mood is tender, morally complicated, and safe-feeling in the middle of something unsafe.

**Global rendering rule (critical):** every visible surface—skin, hair, fabric, marble, metal, sky, ice, flowers, serpents, papers—covered in ultra-intricate patterns (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lace), but these pattern “skins” remain perfectly **flat, static, collage-like**, never warping or following the 3D form beneath; the bodies and architecture can twist in deep perspective, yet the ornament stays locked to the picture plane, creating a hypnotic paradox of flat decoration over volumetric anatomy.

Ultra-dense micro-detail in the corners (tiny inspection stamps, hairline cracks, embroidered prayers, border signage reduced to illegible glyphs), high textural contrast, painterly yet razor-sharp, no empty space, no readable single narrative, no modern logos, no watermark, no clear text—an emotionally intelligent Rorschach of taboo mercy at the edge of time.
