**Aspect ratio 2:3, portrait.** Extreme low-angle view from the viewer’s knees in deep snow, looking up into a **snowbound monastery carved inside a frozen waterfall**—monumental arches of ice like cathedral buttresses, prayer niches embedded in translucent glacier, icicle-stalactites hanging like organ pipes, every corner crowded with relics, broken clocks, rosaries, gears, feathers, and frost-dusted petals suspended midair as if time has been paused. Centered hero tableau: **the Shah and the Inventor** as mythic, non-literal figures—an androgynous monarch with a crown of icicles and halo-rings, velvet regalia cut like ceremonial armor, and a serene, burdened gaze; beside (and partly behind) them an inventor-saint with delicate mechanical limbs, a cracked porcelain mask, and hands stained with soot and gold leaf—**they are touching with unmistakable care**: the Shah gently cradles the Inventor’s head/neck as if steadying a fainting lover, while the Inventor carefully wraps the Shah’s wrist with a ribbon-like bandage made from prayer scrolls and wire, tenderness expressed through protective posture, not overt narrative. **Surreal twist: PORTAL DISPLACEMENT is blatant and structural**—rectangular portals slice through the waterfall-monastery like misaligned doorframes; through them, parts of distant rooms are physically displaced into this space (a desert floor intruding into snow, a bedroom ceiling hanging in the nave, a staircase arriving sideways), with objects half-in/half-out (bells, books, birds, keys) frozen mid-transfer; the portals cast impossible shadows and make the architecture contradict itself. **Totems woven into the scene:** a jewel-like **music box** in the Inventor’s palm stands open, its tiny ballerina replaced by a miniature monastery, its winding key turning by itself; the **Eternal Flame of Atar** burns in a crystal brazier held close to the Shah’s chest—warm fire that does not melt the surrounding ice, ash drifting upward like snow; an **eclipse** is visible through the waterfall’s frozen ceiling like an ocular wound of light, reflected repeatedly in shards of ice and in the Shah’s ringed halo. Background counter-narrative: in alcoves and stained-glass ice panels, silhouettes of monks, lovers, and engineers repeat in mirrored pairs, performing ambiguous rites—comforting gestures that could also be restraint; distant bells and gears fused together; watchful faces suggested in carvings, never fully readable. **Lighting & grade:** palpable gentle love—cold moonlit blues and silver in the ice, but the Atar flame and music-box glow create soft amber highlights on cheeks, fingers, and edges, a quiet warmth fighting the glacial setting; atmosphere filled with glittering ice dust like incense. **Global rendering law (non-negotiable):** every surface—skin, hair, fabric, metal, stone, water/ice, sky—covered in hyper-intricate patterns (brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry, stained-glass geometry, woodgrain, starfields, lace), and **these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static like collage cutouts** (they do NOT warp, stretch, bend, or follow form curvature or perspective) while the underlying 3D forms twist and recede, creating a hypnotic paradox everywhere, especially on any visible nude skin which reads as a living tapestry. Style: Klimt/Schiele/Mucha-inflected symbolist surrealism, gallery-quality illustration, ultra-dense detail foreground/midground/background, no empty space, no single readable story, emotionally adult ambiguity, sharp micro-texture, no text, no watermark, no border.
