Aspect ratio 2:3 — Over-the-shoulder viewpoint from just behind a youthful “virgin” figure (androgynous, luminous, vulnerable yet sovereign), their bare back and shoulders rendered as a living icon: skin fully covered in ultra-intricate flat ornament (gold brocade, lacework, micro-circuit filigree, thorn-vine arabesques, stained-glass tessellation), the pattern layer perfectly planar and unmoving like a collage cutout, refusing to wrap around the body’s curves; ahead of them stands an impossibly old elder (not merely human—part basalt, part moth, part archivist), stooped yet tender, face half-mask/half-portrait, hands poised as if blessing and bargaining at once. They are locked in intimate social gravity—close enough to share breath, separated by an invisible etiquette—while around them a community assembles as a dense ritual circle: many-bodied silhouettes, animal-headed attendants, mirrored doubles, and small childlike elders braided together; their clasped hands form a communal lattice that becomes architecture, implying belonging as a physical structure rather than a feeling. The stage is a volcanic plateau made of shattered obsidian mirrors—black glass slabs, razor cracks, reflective puddles of cooled lava—crowded to the horizon with stacked altars, basalt ribs, and reflective monoliths so there is no empty sky; every surface (stone, ash, metal, hair, fabric, smoke, water, glass, teeth, fingernails, banner threads) is saturated with intricate flat pattern-skins that stay perfectly static and non-perspectival, creating a hypnotic paradox between volumetric forms and “pasted-on” decorative worlds. The defining impossible event: weather containment made blatant—multiple climates are physically trapped and displayed like reliquaries: a thunderstorm sealed inside a hovering crystal sarcophagus above the circle (lightning frozen mid-fork), a snowfall confined within a hanging lantern-cage, a miniature sunrise bottled in a jar, and a ribbon of wind pinned to a spindle; droplets, ash, and petals hang motionless in midair as if time itself is holding its breath. In the midground, a monumental Sunrise Gate rises like an ornate archway of dawn-light turned into stone, its inner void showing a different morning than the one outside; it frames the ritual without explaining it. A half-burned candle (wax patterned with ancient script and floral damask, flame perfectly still) is cradled between the virgin and the elder—shared custody, ambiguous offering—its melted wax forming tiny static “rivers” of ornament that ignore gravity. The Derafsh Kaviani is physically present as a regal, battle-worn standard woven into the scene: a jeweled banner-constellation suspended from basalt horns, its tassels patterned like starfields and royal carpets, simultaneously triumphant and mourning, reflected infinitely in the obsidian shards. Color grade and lighting: contentment in perfect stillness—warm, low sunrise golds and soft violets diffused through volcanic haze, gentle rim light outlining figures like sacred illustrations, no harsh violence, only quiet dread hiding inside tenderness. Fill every corner with readable micro-events that remain unresolved: mirrored faces that don’t match bodies, tiny communal offerings (keys, rings, teeth, seeds, sealed letters), embedded eyes in the stone, lace-like smoke, and reflections showing alternate versions of the same gathering—make it a crowded, gallery-quality surrealist tableau (Klimt/Schiele/Mucha-meets-classical painting), erotically vulnerable but never pornographic, a polysemic frozen dream that feels remembered rather than explained.
