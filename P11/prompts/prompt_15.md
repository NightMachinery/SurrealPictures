Create a crowded 2:3 vertical, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit/Rorschach ambiguity) of a funerary avenue that feels both ceremonial and teasing: a narrow procession street paved with cracked onyx and pearl bone-dust, lined on both sides with tiered, silent balconies like mausoleum boxes in an opera house—every balcony crowded with motionless faceless observers, veiled statues, empty chairs, and draped banners that *almost* look like wings. In the foreground stands “the Guardian”: a mythic paired presence in intimate tension—one tall, androgynous sentinel with a calm, heavy posture and half-bared torso (sensual but not pornographic), one nonhuman counterpart (lion-bird or moth-stag) leaning protectively into them; their hands/limbs interlock as if restraining and releasing each other at once, the social bond unmistakable (care vs control, devotion vs escape). The core metaphor is Flight/Liberation, but frozen mid-impossibility: the entire avenue is caught in a paused updraft—coffin-lids, love letters, rosary beads, feathers, keys, petals, broken mirrors, and tiny balcony railings drift upward like a mischievous confetti storm; gravity is undone yet nothing blurs, every object pinned in crisp stasis as if time itself is holding its breath.

Make Object Personification the defining broken logic: the Stopped Clock is physically present as a large, ornate pocket-watch embedded in the street like a manhole—its hands frozen at an emotionally suggestive hour, its glass face behaving like living skin with a subtle grin and half-lidded eyes, exhaling moths; nearby, smaller clocks perch on balconies like birds, craning their “necks” to watch. The Sunrise Gate is a monumental archway at midground, woven into the avenue’s architecture, but it is also a character: a radiant threshold with a luminous “throat” of dawn that seems to beckon, its light spilling forward like fabric; the gate’s sunrise behaves like a playful accomplice, tugging at tassels, lifting hems, stealing shadows, turning mourning ribbons into kite strings. Atmosphere: Mischief (gleeful trouble) in the color grade—carnival warmth (apricot, honey, coral, electric teal accents) intruding into funereal blacks and violets; lighting like sunrise filtered through stained glass, with sly highlights that make the scene feel caught in a beautiful prank.

Global rendering rule (must be consistent): every visible surface—skin, hair, stone, sky, drifting debris, metal, cloth, smoke—covered in intricate flat decorative pattern layers (brocade, damask, lacework, circuitry, thorn filigree, woodgrain, starfields, stained-glass tracery), but these patterns remain perfectly planar and unmoving like collage cutouts or decal-skins; they must NOT warp, stretch, or follow curvature even as the underlying forms twist in deep perspective, creating a hypnotic paradox of flat ornament over volumetric bodies/architecture. Fill foreground/midground/background and corners with micro-narrative fragments that never resolve: a balcony curtain becoming a paper airplane; a gravestone sprouting a laughing mask; a keyhole shaped like a mouth; a bouquet whose stems are tiny ladders; shadows that detach and hover like pets. Composition: dense, baroque, no empty horizons, every inch a puzzle; painterly elegance with Klimt/Schiele/Mucha ornamentation fused to classical chiaroscuro and high-detail surrealism; crisp linework, rich texture, emotionally intelligent ambiguity—longing/shame/ecstasy/grief/tenderness all plausible at once, no single readable story.
