**2:3 vertical, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit, polysemic, no text):** In a crowded chamber of **mushroom catacombs**—ribbed vaults grown from pale mycelium and giant gilled pillars—**ember spores** drift like slow sparks, lighting everything with a warm, post-storm glow that feels like a breath finally released (**relief, weight lifted**). At the center, two mythic figures interact with intimate gravity: **the Vessel**, an androgynous, near-nude hollow-bodied icon whose torso is a translucent amphora/cage (a body made to hold what cannot be held), stands slightly bowed with palms open; pressed close is **the Celebrant**, a tall fungal-moth priest with a softened, almost tender posture, one hand at the Vessel’s throat as if checking a pulse, the other pouring an unseen offering. The impossible “Frozen Dream” is blatant and defining: **portal displacement** fractures the room into misaligned slices—arched doorways open onto different parts of the same catacomb at wrong angles; the Celebrant’s arm emerges from a portal behind the Vessel while their shoulder remains in front; a chain of portals steps across the scene like cut-out windows, relocating objects mid-air without motion blur. The poured offering becomes a looping ribbon of sand-water-light that repeatedly **falls through portals**, reappearing higher each time, and finally resolves into a cracked **hourglass** suspended upside down, its “sand” streaming upward in perfect stillness. A monumental **Cypress of Kashmar** is physically present yet impossible: its trunk rises from a sarcophagus niche, but its roots bloom overhead like a crown through a displaced ceiling portal, needles rendered as jeweled tesserae; carved into its bark are faint ring-cycles like annual timekeeping wounds. **Jacob’s Ladder** is not an illustration but a contradiction embedded in architecture: a ladder of bone-and-stained-glass rungs ascends diagonally, then continues through a portal into the floor, then again into the air—an endless rung-cycle that doubles as a procession route for tiny faceless acolytes, each carrying miniature vessels that are also tiny doorways. **Mandate for surfaces:** every visible surface—skin, hair, stone, spores, fungus, fabric, metal, water—must be covered in intricate patterning (brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lace), and **all patterns must remain perfectly flat and static like collage cutouts, never warping to the 3D forms** (the figures and architecture may twist in perspective, but the pattern “skins” stay locked and unmoving across the entire image). Fill every corner with clues that refuse to resolve: masks fused to mushrooms, rosary-beads that are tiny hourglasses, broken reliquaries leaking ember spores, a second distant pair echoing the central embrace as shadow-puppets inside a portal, fallen crowns that look like vertebrae, frescoes that depict the scene incorrectly. Color grade: warm ember-gold with cool subterranean violets, tender highlights on patterned flesh, deep velvety shadows; hyper-detailed, Klimt/Schiele/Mucha-inflected ornamental surrealism with classical painterly depth, razor-sharp microtexture, dense foreground–midground–background, no empty space, no readable single narrative, a paused ritual-cycle that feels remembered but unplaceable.
