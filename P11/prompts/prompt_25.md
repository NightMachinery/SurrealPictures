Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (Klimt + Schiele linework + Mucha ornament, symbolist chiaroscuro), a “frozen dream” inside a moss-choked hydroelectric chapel carved into mountain caverns: foreground cluttered with wet prayer books, corroded turbines, dangling rosary-beads made of river stones, ivy-wrapped cables, drifting ash and suspended water droplets like glass pearls; midground a mythic pair intertwined in tense intimacy—The Storyteller (androgynous, partially nude like a classical icon, body a living tapestry) cradles an impossible book that is also a spillway gate, pages unfolding into river-current; The Rationalist (tall, severe, in a ritual engineer’s coat of etched brass) holds calipers and a cracked sextant like sacred tools, one hand on the Storyteller’s shoulder as if measuring grief—both protagonists unmistakably **faceless**, their heads smooth and featureless as if erased, yet a close-up dominates the frame: only two eye-openings exist, and within the irises are miniature worlds in perfect detail (one iris reflects a tiny abandoned bed drifting in a flooded nave, the other a jubilant uprising of red-gold sparks around a turbine-halo), making the gaze the only “face”; background architecture dense and consuming—arched buttresses of concrete and bone, stained-glass sluice doors, choir lofts turned into generator catwalks, a huge **Faravahar** embedded as a luminous mechanical relief above the altar like a winged voltage diagram; a **cornucopia** is physically present as a ruptured horn-shaped conduit pouring out not fruit but blinding offerings—coins, teeth, lilies, circuit fragments, lover’s letters, moths—caught midair in ecstatic suspension; the theme is abandonment/desolation without a single empty horizon: empty pews half-submerged, missing saints, torn banners, footprints that end abruptly, a chapel that looks recently evacuated yet violently celebratory; atmosphere of **euphoria and defiance**—overexposed white-gold light shafts like a revelation colliding with rebellious crimson firelight, sparks and aurora reflecting off wet stone; paradoxical rendering mandate (apply to EVERYTHING): every visible surface—skin, hair, cloth, moss, stone, water, sky, metal—covered in intricate flat patterns (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, lace, starfields, stained-glass tessellation), and these pattern “skins” must remain perfectly planar and unmoving like collage cutouts, NEVER warping or following the 3D curvature beneath, even as bodies and architecture twist in deep perspective; composition is strict layer-cake depth with aggressive occlusion—corners packed with relics, gears, feathers, broken chains, tiny votive flames burning underwater—no clear narrative, only a crowded, emotionally intelligent riddle where tenderness and dread share the same blinding joy.
