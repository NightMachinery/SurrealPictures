Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration for an adult Dixit card: a crowded orbiting chapel interior seen at a three‑quarter cinematic angle with deep parallax (foreground relics almost touching the “lens,” midground altar-steps and figures, background vaults opening to starfields and a looming eclipse), frozen mid‑catastrophe mid‑blessing as *displacement* breaks physics—gravity vectors disagree in different parts of the room, whole architectural slices (arches, pews, confessionals, bell-ropes) are shifted a few meters sideways from where they “should” be, shadows detach and drift to unrelated owners, and small personal objects (rings, shoes, rosaries, teeth, letters, bandages) hover in the wrong places like misfiled memories; at the center stands **the Idol**: a timeless androgynous, near-nude mythic presence with the stillness of a reliquary statue and the tenderness of a caregiver, gently supporting/being supported by a second mirrored Idol-self (or attendant) as if the same soul is in recovery from itself—one figure’s hands cradle the other’s sternum while the other ties a ribbon around a fracture in the air, their eye contact compassionate yet unreadable (longing/shame/relief all plausible); the theme **healing / recovery** is shown through impossible repair: kintsugi-like gold seams stitching broken stone, torn frescoes re-laminating, hairline cracks in space being sutured with thread made of light, wilted lilies rehydrating into constellations, and melted wax forming protective scar-tissue around wounds in the architecture; physically present totems: a heavy **Ouroboros** ring (serpent biting its tail) used as a halo-constraint around one Idol’s head *and* as a floating orbit-line around the chapel’s nave, and a monumental **Mandala** as the chapel’s rose window / floor mosaic simultaneously, radiating warm mercy like a heartbeat; “eclipse bells mark time” throughout: dozens of ornate bells in concentric orbits, each bell eclipsing a tiny sun-disc as it passes, all frozen at different phases, their clappers displaced outside their shells; apply a strict global rendering paradox: every surface—skin, hair, stone, sky, metal, glass, water, smoke—covered in hyper-dense flat pattern layers (brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry, lace, stained-glass tessellation, star maps), and **these patterns must remain perfectly flat, static, and unwarped like collage decals, not following curvature or perspective**, even on twisting bodies and receding architecture, creating hypnotic contradiction between volumetric forms and unmoving ornament; collage layout: kaleidoscopic quadrant repetition of the chapel’s geometry and figures with intentional breaks where displaced elements cross the seams, like a sacred poster-mosaic misregistered in places; atmosphere of **compassionate healing warmth**: amber-gold candlelight mixed with soft eclipse-blue rim light, tender bloom, intimate chiaroscuro, no empty space—fill corners with floating debris (petals, stitches, beads, shattered bell-metal, tiny mirrored votives, feathered ash, anatomical-looking flowers, miniature saints/cherubs rendered as patterned cutouts), ambiguous expressions and symbols everywhere, no text, no clear single narrative, the feeling of a half-remembered dream that hurts and comforts at once, Klimt–Schiele vulnerability with Mucha ornament and classical painterly gravitas, ultra-detailed, crisp edges, surreal sacred intimacy.
