Telephoto-compressed, crowded 2:3 frame inside an overstuffed, abandoned grandmother’s salon—velvet settees, cracked mirrors, lace curtains, piled music boxes, teacups, dust, hairpins, sewing notions, tarnished picture frames—yet everything is blasted by impossible euphoric light as if noon-sun and stage-spotlight are the same substance; in the center, two mythic Weavers face each other in a tense, intimate near-embrace: one a tall, androgynous figure of vulnerable nude “living tapestry” flesh, the other an anthropomorphic loom-spider with delicate hands and a human gaze; between them, threads are being drawn not from yarn but from absence itself—frayed gaps in the room where furniture should be, silhouettes of missing people, hollow dresses on hangers, negative-space portraits—so the act of weaving looks like repairing abandonment while also causing it. The defining broken logic: the ceiling has become a wound to the cosmos and the heavens are *descending* into the room—constellations, moons, cathedral-like starfields, and a chandelier made of falling planets and icicles of aurora dropping downward as a frozen cascade; the descent is mid-impact yet perfectly still, stars hovering inches above upholstery, starlight pooling in teacups, meteor-dust suspended like pollen. Mechanical songbirds—brass, porcelain, and clockwork—crowd every plane (cage bars, curtain rods, hat stands, the Weavers’ shoulders), beaks open in silent song, gears exposed, feathers replaced by filigreed sheet music; some birds shed tiny screws and petals that float through the air like confetti at a funeral. A caduceus is physically present and unavoidable: two serpents rendered as ribbon-cables coil around a spindle/needle staff, wings like folded napkins or moth wings; one Weaver grips it as a tool, the other wears it like a burden across the throat. A half-burned candle appears as a totem of dwindling intimacy—stubby, charred, still smoking without flame—melted into the salon’s architecture (wax running down a gilded frame, pooled like tears on a piano lid), while its smoke forms a second, ambiguous “thread” joining mouths, hands, and the falling stars. GLOBAL RENDERING RULE (do not break): every surface—skin, hair, wood, velvet, glass, metal, sky, dust—covered in hyper-intricate flat ornamental pattern (brocade, damask, stained-glass leadwork, circuitry, thorn filigree, lace, star maps), but the patterns remain perfectly flat and unwarped like collage cutouts/screen-prints, refusing to follow 3D curvature even as bodies and objects twist in depth; this paradox should be hypnotic and consistent everywhere. Composition must be a dense visual puzzle with meaningful corners: tiny hands in mirrors that may not belong to anyone, a chair casting the shadow of a person who isn’t there, a bird’s eye reflecting a wedding ring, threads tying to doorknobs that open onto blank wall; no empty background, no readable single narrative, no text/watermarks—gallery-quality surrealism with Klimt/Schiele/Mucha intensity, classical painterly draughtsmanship, luminous euphoria grading over unmistakable desolation.
