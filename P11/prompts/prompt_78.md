A crowded circular medical amphitheater that has been repurposed into a ceremonial observatory: steep tiered benches packed with brass astrolabes, surgical lamps turned into star-mapping chandeliers, pinned vellum anatomy charts that morph into constellations, jars of opaline organs like planets, incense braziers nestled among instruments, every surface obsessively patterned (brocade, damask, lace, thorn filigree, stained-glass tessellation, circuitry, woodgrain, starfields) — and crucially the patterns behave like perfectly flat collage skins, decal-like and unmoving, never bending or warping to the underlying 3D forms even as bodies and architecture twist in perspective (hypnotic paradox of planar ornament on volumetric matter). Center stage on a raised operating dais: an impossibly ancient Elder (mythic, neither fully human nor animal; gender-ambiguous; face cracked like a fresco, eyes tender and exhausted) and a luminous Trickster (fox-crowned jester-cherub / raven-sainted clown, ageless, mischievous, reverent), posed in an intimate, unmistakable bond without a readable story: their hands almost-touching but linked by a braided ligament of light and suture-thread that stitches the air itself into a quiet embrace; the environment responds like a friend witnessing a vow — instruments subtly lean inward, seats curve as if listening, constellations align around them. Physics is violently broken by SOLID LIQUIDITY as the entire dais and lower floor are a frozen upsurge of “water” made of polished stone: marble waves caught mid-splash, liquid glass cataracts hardened into stair-steps, droplets suspended as gemlike boulders, a river flowing upward into the dome yet locked in a single paused frame (“Frozen Dream,” action implied, motion halted). Lantern-festival presence fills the space: hundreds of paper lanterns drift through the theater like buoyant lungs, some snagged on scalpels and telescope arms, casting warm celebratory gradients; one lantern is a surgical mask turned into a lantern shell. A shared HALO exists but is ambiguous: a radiant ring hovering between Elder and Trickster like a treaty, echoed by smaller halos around instruments and skulls, all rendered as flat gilded iconography. A HALF-BURNED CANDLE is physically present in the Elder’s palm (wax cut cleanly mid-melt, wick ash-gray), yet instead of flame it emits a fan of tiny triumphant starbursts and confetti-motes that hang in the air like sterilized glitter; wax drips float upward and harden into pearls. Color and light: victorious elation — prismatic golds, sunrise ambers, electric teals, triumphant high-key rim light with cathedral-like glow, but threaded with adult tenderness and quiet dread in the shadows; extreme micro-detail everywhere, no empty space, corners packed with drifting petals, sutures, moths, paper cranes, broken lenses, tiny celebratory banners made of medical gauze; surrealist art nouveau + fin-de-siècle symbolist painting energy (Klimt/Schiele/Mucha tension), gallery-quality illustration, crisp focus, layered depth, no text, no watermark. --ar 2:3
