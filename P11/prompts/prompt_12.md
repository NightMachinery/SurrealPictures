Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit, polysemic Rorschach), a “Frozen Dream” frame in a **cinder valley of smoking glass dunes** where the air is crowded with ash, glittering shards, drifting lace, moths, and suspended fragments of forgotten objects (keys, ribbons, cracked photographs, clockwork teeth, wilted flowers, tiny bones) — **no empty horizons, every corner busy**. Center-left: **The Beloved** as a mythic, androgynous figure (tender but terrifyingly present), half-nude, poised like an icon and a mourner at once, reaching forward with a hand that almost touches; center-right: **The Trickster** as a liminal companion (part fox, part harlequin, part masked saint), smiling with kindness that could be cruelty, offering a small open **music box** whose interior is an impossible theater of gears, velvet, and a motionless dancer silhouette made of smoke. Between them, physics is broken by **memory projection**: from the music box and from the Beloved’s chest pours a frozen burst of “recollected” scenes as layered translucent panels—stained-glass dioramas of places that contradict each other (a childhood bedroom, a lovers’ corridor, a hospital hallway, a carnival tent, a winter shoreline), all hovering mid-eruption like shattered time, casting contradictory shadows; each panel contains tiny figures that may or may not be them, and none resolves into a single story. The **half-burned candle** is physically present as a totem: clenched in the Beloved’s other hand or embedded upright in a glass dune like a relic, its flame unnaturally static; wax has spilled into ornate rivers that harden into architectural filigree and stair-steps leading nowhere. Above and also *within* the dunes, the **aurora borealis** appears as a luminous ribbon that doubles as a tapestry curtain and a neural diagram, bathing the scene in aching, distant light (cold greens and bruised violets cut by warm amber candle-glow), emphasizing **longing-as-distance**: the two protagonists are intimate yet separated by an invisible fold, as if the space between their fingertips is years. **Global rendering rule (crucial paradox):** every visible surface—skin, hair, eyes, smoke, glass, stone, sky, cloth, metal—must be covered edge-to-edge in intricate patterns (brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry, stained-glass leadwork, woodgrain, starfields, lace), and these pattern “skins” remain perfectly **flat, unwarped, and locked to the picture plane** like collage paper or printed wallpaper (never bending to the 3D curvature), while the underlying forms twist and recede volumetrically beneath them, creating hypnotic contradiction everywhere. Style: symbolist + Art Nouveau opulence with classical draftsmanship (Klimt/Schiele/Mucha era mood), gilded highlights, obsessive micro-detail, cinematic rim light through aurora haze, sharp foreground texture with dense atmospheric midground smoke; emotionally intelligent ambiguity, sensual vulnerability without pornographic explicitness; **no text, no watermark, no clean negative space**.
