Bird’s-eye diorama cutaway of an impossible **bathhouse of rose steam and porcelain murals**, composed with **diptych logic fused into one card**: two stacked/adjacent “panels” separated by an ornate mosaic border yet bleeding into each other through cracks and steam, flattening depth into layered planes like a designed poster-collage; the frame is **crowded corner-to-corner** with tiled basins, hanging arches, alcoves, mirrors, drains, lockers, tassels, ladders, floating petals, keys, hair, gears, broken teacups, talismans, and tiny clustered tableaus that suggest rituals, tenderness, shame, grief, and comedy without resolving into a single story. At the center, a mythic **Elder**—not quite human, part porcelain idol/part exhausted bath attendant/part ancient animal—kneels in a posture of heavy dignity as if the building itself has been leaning on them for centuries; their skin may be nude but rendered as a **living tapestry** (vulnerable, sensual, haunted), while a **Swarm** of dozens of small beings (moths/cherubs/masked bathers/clockwork larvae—anthropomorphic but unfamiliar) clings to them socially: some cradle the Elder’s head, some braid their hair into cords, some tug gently at invisible burdens, some whisper into ears that might be handles, collectively enacting the moment of **relief—weight lifted** (a palpable exhale) while still feeling grotesque and uncanny. The defining broken logic is **object personification**: the bathhouse itself is inhabited by animate things—faucets that clasp hands, towels that embrace, tiles that blink, mirrors that avert their gaze, drains that grin, columns that bend like spines, a porcelain mural that nurses steam—frozen mid-gesture as if caught in a single critical frame of a dream. Integrate the three totems physically and unmistakably: a **flying kite** hovering indoors as if buoyed by rose vapor, its tail threading through multiple rooms and tiny scenes; a monumental **stopped clock** embedded in a mural/arch with hands frozen at an ambiguous hour, also subtly face-like (or ribcage-like), watching without judging; and a **golden fleece** draped like a ceremonial towel over the Elder and simultaneously spilling into the architecture like living insulation, desired and unsettling. Lighting/color grade must communicate **relief**: warm pearly golds and rose-pink steam with cool porcelain highlights, as if after crying, after storm, after release—soft luminous clarity rather than menace—yet the imagery remains grotesque/uncanny through too-intimate details (teeth where grout should be, eyelashes on faucets, tender hands emerging from wallpaper) that never become horror-comic, always painterly and emotionally intelligent. **Global rendering rule (crucial): every surface is densely patterned**—brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, lacework, woodgrain, starfields—on skin, hair, stone, water, steam, porcelain, metal; and these pattern “skins” must remain perfectly **flat and static like screen-printed collage decals locked to the picture plane** (no perspective warp, no stretching around form), while the underlying forms stay fully volumetric and distorted, creating a hypnotic paradox across the entire image. Style target: gallery-quality symbolist Art Nouveau realism (Klimt/Schiele/Mucha energy), maximal detail, no empty horizons, no readable single narrative, no text, no watermark, **aspect ratio 2:3**.
