Vertical 2:3 collectible Dixit card illustration, “The Frozen Dream”: inside a crowded sea-cave court carved like a baroque labyrinth—arches that loop back into themselves, stairways that become coral arteries, mosaicked corridors folding into a single ornate knot—everything lit from below by slow phosphor waves that cast tender, milk-blue and honey-gold light; at the center, two mythic protagonists hover in an impossible, paused gesture of gentle love: **the Avatar** (androgynous, timeless, masked or faceless, body built from nested doorways and map-fragments, a calm sentinel posture) and **the Celebrant** (a crowned, almost-human sea-being—part dancer, part anemone, part saint—leaning in with softened shoulders, offering/receiving touch at the wrist and cheek as if apologizing and forgiving at once); their intimacy is quiet, not performative, yet electrically charged with vulnerability; the defining broken physics is **Containment**—a small stone **wishing well** set into the cave floor contains an entire moonlit ocean and cathedral sky inside it, while the surrounding real ocean is paradoxically poured into glass reliquaries and tight-lidded shells that float around them without spilling, and the cave itself seems contained within the Avatar’s ribcage like a diorama; a luminous **lotus** blooms simultaneously in three places (in the Celebrant’s hands, in the well’s water, and as a giant architectural rosette in the ceiling), implying one object across different moments; encode **before-and-after echoes** as layered silhouettes and sequential hand positions—faint repeats of the pair embracing / separating / almost touching—stacked like frames on one page, with drifting “memory trails” of pearls, keys, seaweed ribbons, broken mirrors, prayer cards, and tiny maze tokens orbiting them; compose with **diptych logic fused into one card**: two stacked planes with decorative borders and tiled panels (left/right or top/bottom) that disagree about perspective, flattening space into a designed collage while the figures remain volumetric; crucial global rendering rule: every surface—skin, hair, stone, water, sky, debris—covered in dense intricate ornament (Klimt-like gold leaf brocade, damask, stained-glass circuitry, thorn filigree, lace, starfields, woodgrain), and these pattern “skins” must remain perfectly flat and static like cut-paper overlays, never warping with form, creating a hypnotic paradox between flat decoration and twisting 3D bodies; corners packed with micro-scenes (tiny processions, miniature labyrinth maps, submerged cherubs made of coral, moths with compass wings, coins mid-wish, bottles holding storms), zero empty space, high ambiguity, emotionally intelligent tenderness with undertones of longing and dread; symbolist Art Nouveau / Schiele linework + Mucha ornament, painterly illustration (not photo), gallery-quality, ultra-detailed, no text, no watermark.
