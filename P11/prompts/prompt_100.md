**Aspect ratio 2:3 — “The Frozen Dream”**: A crowded, gallery-quality surrealist illustration in the spirit of Klimt’s gilded tenderness + Schiele’s vulnerable tension + Mucha’s ornamental myth, paused mid-impossible event: at the center, an androgynous **matchmaker**—part saint, part puppeteer, part midwife—kneels on a floating hearthstone like an altar, spine arched in reverent exhaustion, face half-hidden behind a **comedy/tragedy mask** held to the cheek as if listening through it; from their sleeves unfurl too many hands (some gloved, some bare) calmly braiding **Ariadne’s thread** through rings, needles, and tiny doorways, stitching strangers together without showing who they are. Opposite them, a monumental **phoenix** that is also a warm bed and a burnt cathedral: wings like quilted flames, breast like a furnace of amber light, head bowed in intimate complicity, offering warmth that feels like salvation and a trap at once—its feathers mid-molt into pillows, ashes, and rose petals. The **core metaphor of comfort/warmth** is everywhere: the air looks heated like a soft mirage; broken masonry is stuffed with down; frost on distant windows melts into honey; breath becomes a visible shawl around the figures; even shadows glow gently, as if the dark itself is keeping you safe. The defining broken logic is **musical materialization**: a silent chord hangs in the air as a physical architecture—staff lines become iron balustrades, notes become heavy glass fruit, crescendos become spiraling staircases; a violin’s f-hole opens like a mouth in the wall releasing tangible lullabies as ribbon-smoke; sheet music fractures into origami birds that orbit the phoenix. The second rupture is **anatomical impossibility**: ribcages are visible as ornate cages with doors ajar; a hand contains an eye that’s asleep; a throat becomes a corridor; joints bend the wrong way with serene inevitability—yet everything is posed like a sacred icon, absolutely still. **Global rendering rule (must be consistent across every surface):** every material—skin, hair, ash, stone, flame, sky, fabric, metal, water—covered in hyper-intricate pattern (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, lacework, woodgrain, starfields), but these patterns remain perfectly **flat, collage-like, and unmoving**, never warping to the 3D forms beneath; the bodies twist volumetrically while their pattern “skins” stay locked like cut paper. The atmosphere is **ecstasy (transcendent bliss)**: radiant golds and hot vermilions against deep teals and violet bruises, halos of prismatic light, soft iridescent bloom, sacred-glow chiaroscuro; the overall feeling is a blissful shiver that could be love, grief, shame, or rebirth depending on the viewer. Fill foreground/midground/background with symbolic clutter: scattered matchsticks that are also tiny bones; cracked mirrors reflecting scenes that don’t match; mask-shaped windows in the architecture watching; thread snaring miniature moons; feathers pinned like love letters; melted wax tears; floating keys that unlock nothing; a distant crowd of faceless silhouettes made of lace; in the corners, a tangle of thread spelling almost-words, a pair of masks dangling like fruit, a nest built from sheet-music and hair. Ultra-detailed, no empty space, paradoxical tenderness, ambiguous relationships, no readable single narrative, **tasteful artistic nudity permitted but non-explicit**, cinematic focus with endless micro-detail, professional illustration, high resolution.
