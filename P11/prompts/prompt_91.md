Ultra-wide 14mm viewpoint from knee-height on a claustrophobic volcanic plateau made entirely of fractured obsidian mirrors and black glass dunes (curving edges, barrel distortion), the frame crowded to every corner with reflective shards, drifting ash, moth-like cinders, torn velvet banners, cracked porcelain masks, and ribboned debris; at the center, a mythic **athlete**—androgynous, powerful, half-nude, mid-lunge yet perfectly frozen—skin rendered as a living tapestry (gold-leaf brocade, damask, thorn filigree, circuitry, stained-glass rosettes) while refusing to read as any single gender or era; facing them, the **mirror** is not an object but a tall, sentient presence: a standing slab of blackened reflective glass with hairline fractures forming an almost-face, its surface showing contradictions (the athlete’s posture reversed, a different age, a different wound), as if every reflection is a mask auditioning for dominance; a **friendship bracelet** (frayed, intimate, unmistakably handmade) binds the athlete’s wrist—and its other loop cinches tight around **nothing**, pulled taut by an **invisible presence** that is violently undeniable: ash swirls around a human-shaped void, wet footprints stamp across vertical air, bracelets indent “skin” that isn’t there, and the athlete’s shoulder is dimpled by unseen fingers while multiple mirrors betray different silhouettes that do not exist in the physical scene; the environment itself performs **illusion/mask**—rocks wear theatrical faces, reflections show mouths where there are none, and the plateau’s mirror-cracks align into masquerade profiles that dissolve when followed; a monumental **stopped clock** (pocket-watch scale, ornate, decayed) is embedded in the ground like an altar, its hands fixed at an ambiguous hour, its glass spiderwebbed, and its shadow falling in the shape of someone absent; in the background (no empty horizon), a **lightning-struck tree** erupts from obsidian—charred, vein-branched, wrapped in mirror ribbons and scorched lace—its split trunk framing a hollow silhouette as if lightning carved a person out of wood; lighting and color grade: creeping dread, cold bruised moonlight mixed with low volcanic underglow, sickly green highlights in the smoke, chiaroscuro pockets everywhere, reflections too sharp and too truthful; **GLOBAL RENDERING RULE (non-negotiable): every visible surface is densely patterned, and those patterns remain perfectly flat and unmoving like collage paper/screen-printed decals—never bending, warping, stretching, or following 3D curvature even on skin—creating a hypnotic paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form**; surrealist art-nouveau-meets-symbolist realism (Klimt gold, Schiele vulnerability, Mucha ornament, classical draftsmanship), gallery-quality, insanely intricate, emotionally polysemic, no text, no watermark, aspect ratio 2:3.
