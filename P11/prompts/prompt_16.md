Vertical 2:3 gallery illustration, “Frozen Dream” frame: in the center, a mythic pair intertwined—**the Dreamer** (an androgynous clockwork youth with closed eyes, mouth slightly parted as if mid-confession) cradled by **the Widow** (a tall, calm, moth-queen figure with a black halo-veil, posture both protective and ceremonial), their bodies turning in opposite spirals like a slow dance paused at its climax; above them a **wedding canopy** hangs impossibly weightless, stitched from lace, funeral crepe, and filigreed brass ribs, but behaving like a mechanical organism—its tassels are piston-rods, its embroidery is micro-gears, its fringe is a curtain of tiny articulated hands; the Widow’s fingers hold a **wilting bouquet** that is half flowers/half instruments (lilies dissolving into syringes, roses into valves, stems into braided cables), petals browning into paper and then into metal shavings; behind the Dreamer, **Icarus’s wings** appear not as a costume but as a relic—gilded feather-plates cracked, partially detached, hovering a few inches off the back as if gravity forgot to finish the sentence, some feathers melted into amber drips that never fall; the world is a grotesque mechanical nature cathedral—trees are vertebrae made of carved wood and clock teeth, vines are braided wires sprouting thorns shaped like tiny keys, a river is a ribbon of mercury carrying miniature boats made from wedding rings, and in the sky a sunburst of stained glass rotates without moving, casting triumphant, victorious light (hot golds, opal whites, saturated sapphires) that feels like elation sharpened into a blade; everywhere, physics is loudly broken: a rain of screws, moths, and confetti is suspended mid-tumble, a flock of birds made of porcelain and rivets hangs frozen in a spiral, and a waterfall of petals runs upward into the canopy like reverse gravity applause; crowd every corner with ambiguous micro-scenes—masked cherubs repairing a deer’s mechanical ribcage, a bride’s train turning into a conveyor belt of shells, a crown of thorns growing from a music box, mourning gloves blooming with eyes—no empty space, no single readable story, only layered symbols and emotional contradictions. **Global rendering rule:** every visible surface (skin, hair, fabric, metal, stone, sky, water) is covered in hyper-intricate patterns—brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, lace, starfields—applied as perfectly flat, unmoving decal-like collage skins that do **not** warp with form or perspective (the 3D volumes can twist and recede, but the pattern layer remains rigid and planar everywhere), creating a hypnotic paradox of icon/tapestry vs living body; ultra-detailed, museum-grade draftsmanship, surrealist Art Nouveau + symbolist decadence, sharp focal hierarchy, deep foreground/midground/background density, crisp edges, luminous glazing, no text, no watermark.
