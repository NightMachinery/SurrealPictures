**Aspect ratio 2:3 — “The Frozen Dream”**: A crowded funhouse-cathedral interior built from warped mirror nave panels, gold-leaf ribs, and stacked gilded cages like reliquaries; prismatic stained-glass sunlight detonates into blinding euphoric halos, confetti-dust, floating feathers, torn tickets, alchemical sigils, and tiny moths made of jewelry—no empty space anywhere, every corner packed with clues. Center foreground: a mythic **Alchemist** (not fully human: an elegant, androgynous ibis-headed figure of tarnished brass and velvet shadow, hands in surgical poise) and a **Virgin** (a serene, nude, marble-soft figure whose face is partly a blank icon-mask, partly a childlike saint, partly a knowing adult—tender and terrifying at once) lean toward each other across a thin seam of mirror as if the air itself is a taboo curtain; their fingers almost meet but the “forbidden” is literal: **the word TABOO appears as a physical lock** sealing their shared breath, a padlock fused to a mouth-shaped keyhole hovering between them, and the key is an eyelash-thin needle held trembling by the Alchemist. The impossible physics is explicit: **mirrors behave like liquid doors**—a frozen splash of reflective glass pours upward into a staircase; **gravity reverses only for symbols**, so rosaries, wedding rings, shackles, and halos drift like balloons while bodies remain anchored; a kiss is suspended as a crystalline fracture in midair, never landing. The Virgin’s body is a living tapestry—skin rendered as perfectly flat, unwarped ornamental planes (Klimt gold mosaics, damask lace, thorn filigree, circuitry, starfield marquetry) laid over voluptuous 3D form **without following curvature** (static decal-collage effect across all surfaces); the same paradoxical flat-pattern “skins” cover hair, metal, stone, sky-through-windows, cages, and water in basins—patterns stay locked while forms twist. The **Derafsh Kaviani** is present as a sacred banner/standard rising behind them, woven into the architecture: a lion-sun emblem in jeweled appliqué, fringed with ribbons like severed daylight, its pole threaded through a cage altar and reflected infinitely in the mirrors; it simultaneously reads as flag, wound dressing, and coronation. A **beanstalk** erupts from a small forbidden vial at their feet (the vial shaped like a reliquary-heart), climbing straight through the cathedral ceiling and also sideways across the picture plane like a collage strip; its leaves are tiny stained-glass hands and its pods are locked boxes, each box reflecting a different version of the pair. Midground: cages contain impossible occupants—doves made of clock parts, a sleeping judge’s wig, a laughing fetus-shaped pearl, an empty wedding dress that casts a human shadow—while mirror panels show contradictory poses (embrace / accusation / blessing / dissection) all at once, encouraging multiple readings. Background: a rose-window becomes a roulette wheel of saints, lovers, and executioners; organ pipes are syringes; chandeliers drip molten gold that freezes into sharp lace. Color grade: ecstatic, radiant, champagne-gold and opal neon with violent clarity (euphoria that can also be dread); render as gallery-quality symbolist Art Nouveau + classical draftsmanship + Schiele-like tension, designed like a poster-diptych with mosaic borders, stacked planes, and deliberate collage-flat space compression; hyper-detailed, high ambiguity, paradox-heavy, emotionally intelligent, no single narrative, every surface intricately patterned with **flat, non-warping decorative textures**.
