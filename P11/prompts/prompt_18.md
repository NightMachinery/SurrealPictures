Vertical 2:3 “Frozen Dream” tableau: a vaulted, Art‑Nouveau psychoanalytic chamber staged like a ceremonial balance—perfect bilateral symmetry down the centerline, yet every mirrored detail subtly disagrees (a blink, a mismatch of hands, a different shadow). On a central plinth, **two mythic Therapists** face each other across a floating, weightless therapy couch that has become **soft sculpture**: upholstered like velvet but drooping like warm wax, half‑anatomical (suggestive ribs, seams like sutures), half‑furniture; their bodies are timeless and androgynous, partially nude in an icon-like, vulnerable way, skin rendered as living tapestry. One Therapist’s posture is offering/receiving (palms open, throat exposed), the other’s is guiding/judging (fingers poised like a conductor), and between them a thin ribbon of light is “measuring” the air as if weighing an emotion. Above them, a radiant **Faravahar** hangs like a stained‑glass emblem and also like a moral compass—wings outstretched, centered, impossibly calm—casting triumphant, gilded illumination. Near the Therapists, a large **stopped clock** (hands frozen at an ambiguous time) is physically present as an object and as architecture: its face is both a handheld mirror and an oculus in the ceiling, stopped twice in two places at once. **Portal displacement** fractures the room: clean-edged portals slice through space like picture frames; parts of the couch pass through and reappear across the room; an arm reaches into a portal and emerges holding its own wrist from the opposite side; a doorway opens onto the same room but rotated 180°, creating a symmetrical paradox. Crowd every plane: foreground cluttered with suspended debris—confetti like therapy notes, tiny keys, moths, pills, rose thorns, broken glass, inkblots, silk ribbons, chess pieces, a scale pan without a scale—each hovering mid‑fall, perfectly frozen; midground packed with seated, faceless witnesses in ornate masks (or animal-headed silhouettes) arranged like a chorus; background filled with patterned drapery, impossible stairways, mirrored cabinets, and floating frames that show alternate angles of the same moment. **Global rendering rule (critical):** every visible surface—skin, hair, eyes, fabric, stone, sky, glass, water, metal—must be covered in dense, intricate pattern (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, woodgrain, starfields, lace, stained glass), and these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static like collage cutouts, never warping or following the curvature/perspective of the 3D forms beneath. Color grade and lighting radiate **triumph**—victorious elation in warm golds, vermilion, lapis, and pearl highlights—yet the emotional reading stays polysemic: tenderness and dread, ecstasy and shame, healing and domination, all simultaneously; ultra‑detailed, no empty space, gallery-quality illustration, Symbolist + Klimt/Schiele/Mucha sensibility, crisp linework, gilded ornament, high micro-detail, no text, no watermark.
