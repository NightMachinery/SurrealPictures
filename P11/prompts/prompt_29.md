A vertical 2:3 “Frozen Dream” tableau staged like a melancholy altar of perfect balance: at the exact centerline, two mythic protagonists meet in an intimate standoff—**the Avatar**, an androgynous, partially nude figure with a porcelain animal mask and a body treated as a living icon, and **the Host**, a towering, courtly **Simurgh** whose wings form a symmetrical canopy like a cathedral apse; they touch palms across a razor-thin fulcrum (a suspended beam/scale/threshold) where neither side wins, their closeness tender yet uneasy, desire and grief braided. The world obeys symmetry as a religion: mirrored pillars, paired staircases, twin horizons, matching constellations—yet tiny deviations (a feather missing, a cracked tile, one eye closed) inject quiet dread. Physics is broken loudly through **weather containment**: a thunderstorm is *kept* like contraband—cumulus clouds folded into glass reliquaries, rain trapped in hanging lanterns as frozen droplets, lightning coiled in a birdcage, a small cyclone sealed inside a tilted hourglass—while outside the containers the air is impossibly calm, as if the sky is holding its breath. A colossal **beanstalk** spirals up through the architecture like a living column, threading balconies and ribs of stone, its leaves shaped like keys and hands, its pods split open to reveal miniature rooms, doors, and sleeping eyes; it both supports and threatens the symmetry, climbing through the Host’s wing-arches and disappearing into a stained-glass moon. Crowd every plane: foreground scattered with broken mirrors, prayer beads, fruit with anatomical interiors, moths and seeds suspended mid-fall, delicate instruments for measuring wind, tiny boats made of feathers, drowned roses, chess pieces made of bone; midground packed with patterned drapery, filigree ladders, floating frames containing different skies; background dense with a palace-city of repeating arches, drowned gardens, and a horizon that doubles like a reflection but never quite matches. Color grade: beautiful grief—antique golds and bruised violets, cold pearl highlights, soot-blues, candlelit shadows, a soft after-rain sheen without actual wetness. Render in a fused Klimt/Schiele/Mucha + old-master oil illustration sensibility: **every visible surface** (skin, hair, feathers, stone, sky, water, glass, metal) is covered in intricate ornament (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained-glass tracery, woodgrain, starfields, lace), and crucially these pattern “skins” remain **perfectly flat and unmoving**, never warping to the 3D form beneath—collage-like decorative planes laid over volumetric bodies and architecture, producing a hypnotic paradox everywhere. Extreme detail, no empty space, no text, no logos, gallery-quality, emotionally ambiguous, a single paused instant implying an impossible event without resolving it.
