**2:3 vertical, “Frozen Dream” frame, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit / Rorschach ambiguity), Vienna Secession + Symbolist oil painting precision with Art Nouveau linework (Klimt/Schiele/Mucha echoes), extreme density, no empty horizons, every corner filled.** Viewpoint is *inside* the scene: a voyeur’s angle peering **from behind layered translucent textiles**—gauze, wet organza, and torn brocade veils in the foreground, lit from within; their embroidery and fringe form a semi-opaque “curtain” the viewer looks through. Beyond the veils, on a **storm prairie crowded with lightning-struck totems** (charred poles, antler pylons, shattered stained-glass obelisks, bone-latticed scarecrows, rusted antennae, prayer wheels, thorn filigree), the **Oracle & the Fool** meet as mythic nonhuman protagonists locked in a charged near-touch: the Oracle is a tall, serene, androgynous *moth-priest / glass-icon* with halo-like ribs and many calm hands; the Fool is a cracked *marionette-saint / feral cherub* with mismatched limbs and a brave, trembling grin—both poised as if about to kiss, bargain, or devour each other’s secrets, tenderness and danger indistinguishable. **Sensuality/passion** is expressed as the environment reacting: prairie grass becomes velvet tongues and thorned lace; heat-haze takes the shape of caressing fingers; raindrops bead like pearls along invisible skin; a slow spiral of petals/ash/letters/feathers/pomegranate seeds rises around them like a sigh made visible. The impossible rule is **bold sensory synesthesia**: thunder is seen as luminous calligraphy ribbons; lightning forks into audible-looking stained-glass shards; perfume clouds become musical notation; whispered words drip as honey-colored smoke; colors appear to *taste* metallic and sweet, floating as cutout icons near mouths and hands—yet everything is frozen mid-eruption. Physically present, woven into the scene: a **skull** (half-buried in patterned sod, eye sockets holding tiny storms), a fractured **Tower of Babel** reimagined as a stacked totem-architecture of languages and bricks rising from the prairie (part ruin, part birth), and **comedy/tragedy masks** dangling like fruit from wires and thorn vines, some worn, some fused into the totems, some cracked open to reveal teeth or mirrors. **Global rendering paradox mandate:** every visible surface—skin, hair, fabric, bone, stone, sky, rain, fire—covered in intricate **flat, unmoving pattern skins** (brocade, damask, circuitry, woodgrain, starfields, stained-glass tessellation, lace, thorn filigree) that stay perfectly planar like collage cutouts pinned to the picture plane and **do not warp with form**, even as the underlying bodies and architecture twist in deep perspective. Lighting/color grade: rebellious defiance—ember reds, bruised violets, electric cobalt, hot gold leaf highlights, storm-black shadows—high contrast, tactile atmosphere, layered depth (foreground veil texture → midground figures → background babel-totems), hyper-detailed, emotionally intelligent ambiguity, no single readable narrative, crowded visual puzzle.
