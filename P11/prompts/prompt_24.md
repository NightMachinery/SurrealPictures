Portrait 2:3, a crowded “frozen dream” tableau rendered like a fin‑de‑siècle masterpiece (Klimt gold leaf opulence + Schiele nervous line + Mucha ornamental framing + classical chiaroscuro), gallery-quality illustration, ultra-detailed, no empty space: a mythic GIANT kneels in a collapsed ballroom-carnival that feels half cathedral, half nursery, half mausoleum; the Giant’s presence is tender and terrifying—one hand cupped open like a stage, the other holding a tiny cracked music box—while a MATCHMAKER (not human: an elegant, long-limbed bird‑masked seamstress with many hands, half midwife half puppeteer) stands on the Giant’s palm tying ribbons with ceremonial care, eyes downcast as if blessing and betraying at once. The air is full of PLAY/Joy that has turned bittersweet: marbles orbit like planets, paper boats sail through dust, jacks and dice float mid‑tumble, a child’s skipping rope forms a halo, confetti becomes falling petals and ash; laughter is implied but unheard, as if remembered.

Centerpiece MAYPOLE rises through the scene like a spine; its ribbons are filmstrips / lace banners / braided nerve-cords that the Matchmaker knots to invisible partners, and every knot triggers the broken physics of MEMORY PROJECTION: instead of shadows, the ribbons project vivid, contradictory “memories” onto everything—on walls, skin, water, and clouds you see overlapping translucent vignettes (a wedding that might be a funeral, a playground that might be a battlefield, a kiss that might be a goodbye), all simultaneous and unreadable, like multiple lives leaking through one frame. A SIMURGH (majestic, ambiguous, neither bird nor angel) is physically present, perched and also dispersed—its body formed from mosaic feathers, gilded anatomy charts, and stained-glass wings that shed tiny feather-icons into the air; its gaze lands nowhere and everywhere, as if it remembers the viewer. JACOB’S LADDER ascends impossibly from the Giant’s sternum and also from the cracked floor—rungs made of ivory dominoes and bone‑white embroidery hoops—leading upward into a low ceiling that opens like a wound into starfield, yet the ladder’s top never resolves.

GLOBAL RENDERING RULE (crucial): every surface without exception—skin, hair, ribbon, stone, sky, water, feathers, dust—must be covered in dense intricate patterns (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, woodgrain, lace, star maps, illuminated-manuscript marginalia), but these pattern “skins” remain perfectly FLAT and STATIC like collage paper or screen-printed overlays: they do not bend, warp, stretch, or follow curvature; they keep a fixed orientation as the 3D forms twist beneath them, creating a hypnotic paradox of flat ornament on volumetric anatomy.

Mood/lighting: melancholy “beautiful grief,” late twilight with bruised blues and antique gold, soft rim light like candles under rainclouds, luminous dust motes; sensual, artistic nudity is allowed as vulnerability—tapestry-flesh bodies half-draped in patterned veils, faces partially hidden, emotions readable but motives not. Fill foreground/midground/background with ambiguous totems and corner puzzles: masks with tear-shaped pearls, broken mirrors reflecting different seasons, tiny hands pulling unseen strings, chessmen made of sugar, wilted flowers sprouting keys, water pooling upside-down on the ceiling; no text, no logos, no clean negative space, no single clear narrative—only a dense, polysemic Rorschach dream paused at its most intimate contradiction.
