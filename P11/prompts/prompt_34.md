Portrait 2:3, a single “frozen dream” frame inside an **ice-shelf labyrinth under polar halos (aurora rings)**, shot from **knee-height** with an **ultra‑wide lens / barrel distortion (curving edges, stretched corners)**, the whole scene **crowded in every layer** (foreground shards, midground corridors, background chambers—no empty horizon). **Center hero:** a mythic **Healer** and **Virgin** locked in an intimate, socially charged interaction that reads as both blessing and transgression: the Healer (androgynous, tender, authoritative; hands stained with luminous frost-gold) cups the Virgin’s face while simultaneously stitching a wound that is also a veil; the Virgin (serene, fearful, consenting, resisting—unclear) leans in as if to kiss or confess, their bodies partially nude in an **icon-like vulnerability** (adult, sensual, not pornographic). The **taboo/forbidden** is expressed as the environment “censoring” them: ice walls bloom with warning halos, stitched seams, wax seals, mirrored eyes, and sanctified locks; delicate red threads and lace bandages float like evidence; doors are half‑open yet chained; footprints appear where no one stands. **Gigantism is the defining impossibility:** one of the two figures is **colossal**, reclining through the labyrinth like a fallen cathedral statue—shoulders spanning corridors, fingers resting in distant rooms—yet the other remains human-scale and close, creating a paradox of tenderness across impossible scale; tiny explorers, candles, and relics cling to the giant’s ornaments to confirm scale. **Zahhak’s shoulder serpents are physically present:** two ornate serpents emerge from the giant’s shoulders (or carved into the architecture as living bas-relief), their mouths gentle as midwives, not monsters—one nuzzling a bandage, one whispering into an ear—ambiguously protective or corrupting. A **stopped clock** (hands frozen at an unreadable time) is embedded in the ice like a stained-glass porthole, cracked but unmelted, leaking tiny moths, teeth, and snowflakes; scattered pocket-watches and clockwork ribs echo it throughout the maze. **Triptych-like internal partitioning within one frame:** the labyrinth forms three vertical “panels” via ice arches and curtain-like veils—left panel shows a ceremonial clinic (beds of coral-ice, syringes of pearl, votive jars), center panel the intimate embrace, right panel a counter‑narrative procession of faceless figures carrying mirrors and censored banners—each panel visually rhymes with the others (repeated hands, repeated veils, repeated serpents) while refusing a single story. **Lighting/color:** tender, gentle love—soft gold and blush warmth from within the ice against blue-violet polar night; aurora halos cast mother-of-pearl gradients; breath becomes glittering pollen. **Global rendering rule (critical):** every surface—skin, hair, ice, cloth, stone, sky, water, metal—covered in **hyper-intricate flat pattern-skins** (brocade, damask, lace, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields) that remain **perfectly planar and unmoving**, never warping with perspective or anatomy, like collage cutouts laid over volumetric forms; the 3D forms can twist and recede, but the patterns stay locked in place, creating a hypnotic paradox. Style target: **Klimt gold-leaf opulence + Schiele vulnerability + Mucha ornament + symbolist/surreal classical painting**, museum-grade detail, sharp micro-texture everywhere, atmospheric depth packed with clues; no text, no watermark, no simple narrative payoff.
