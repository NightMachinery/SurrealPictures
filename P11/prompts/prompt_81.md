Vertical **2:3** gallery-quality surrealist illustration, “frozen dream” moment on a **storm prairie crowded with lightning‑struck totems**: tall burnt poles, shattered idols, and rootlike pylons jam the foreground/midground/background with no empty horizon; **forked lightning is paused mid‑impact** like stained-glass fractures suspended in air. Center-left, a mythic **Chef** (androgynous, saintly yet exhausted, ink-dark eyes, ceremonial apron like a vestment) leans forward in quiet intimacy toward a towering **Beast** (wolf‑lion‑bull hybrid with humanlike hands and a tender, ashamed posture), their faces almost touching as if negotiating mercy; the Chef **offers a gift**—a warm, impossibly heavy bundle/covered platter cupped in both hands, but the “gift” is **generosity made visible**: it leaks a **breadcrumb trail** that spirals across the ground and up into the air, each crumb becoming a tiny floating reliquary. **Memory projection breaks physics**: from the Beast’s chest and from the Chef’s fingertips, dozens of translucent “slides” of half-remembered scenes (rooms, embraces, departures, rituals, strangers’ mouths, childhood corners, hospital curtains, wedding lace, hunting teeth, lullabies) **project outward as flat cutout panels** that overlap the prairie like a collage—some comforting, some humiliating, none fully legible—casting the wrong shadows and refusing perspective, as if memory is a physical weather system. Work the **Faravahar** into the storm itself (a radiant winged-disc sigil formed by converging lightning and smoke) and carve/brand a large **compass rose** into a broken totem and into the platter’s lid, subtly echoing everywhere (hoofprints, grass whorls, cloud vortices). **Emotion = relief (weight lifted):** color-grade with post-storm breath—soft dawn golds and bone whites cutting through bruised indigo clouds, a gentle luminous haze around the offered gift, the Beast’s shoulders slackening as if forgiven; tenderness and dread coexist. **Global rendering rule (mandatory paradox):** every surface—skin, fur, horns, hair, metal, wood, clouds, grass, debris, lightning—must be densely filled with intricate **flat, unmoving pattern skins** (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, starfields, lacework, woodgrain), applied like screen-printed collage: the 3D forms can twist and recede, but the ornament layers **must remain perfectly planar and unwarped**, ignoring curvature and perspective. Corners packed with symbolic detritus (burnt recipe cards without readable text, cracked mirrors reflecting someone else, feathers, bones, spoons, tiny compass needles, petals, charred bread) drifting in still air; highly detailed, polysemic, no captions, no single narrative, masterpiece-level linework and painterly finish in the spirit of Klimt/Schiele/Mucha with classical chiaroscuro and surreal collage logic.
