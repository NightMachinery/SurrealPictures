Elevated balcony viewpoint into a floating customs office for dream travelers, seen through a dense curtain of hanging foreground objects—swaying passport photos with no faces, knotted luggage tags like prayer slips, damp lace veils, chandeliers made from keys and tiny bones, translucent curtains of stamped paperwork—framing a crowded midground checkpoint where the **Parent** and the **Fool** exist as mythic protagonists: the Parent a vast, tender-terrible figure (part matron, part customs architecture, part moth-queen), cradling and appraising the Fool as if weighing a soul; the Fool a harlequin marionette-adult with childlike posture and knowing eyes, half-stepping forward yet frozen, offering a passport that looks like a peeled layer of skin, while the Parent’s other hand presses a seal into the air itself. The entire scene is grotesque/uncanny but heartbreakingly intimate: inspection desks resemble altars, ink pads resemble bruised organs under glass, queues of dream travelers are elegant silhouettes with suitcase-ribs and soft masks, each corner cluttered with contraband memories—perfume bottles full of seawater, wedding rings on fishhooks, teeth in velvet pouches, cracked toys, dried bouquets, miniature coffins of letters—everything suspended in a “Frozen Dream” pause mid-transaction, mid-judgment, mid-embrace. The defining impossibility is **emotional weather**: melancholy has become climate—inside the customs hall a slow storm of translucent tears falls sideways in perfect sheets, then stops abruptly at invisible boundaries of shame-fog; overhead, clouds form from exhaled sighs and drift through doorframes; lightning flickers silently in the shape of branching veins across the ceiling; tiny sun-showers of glittering salt rise upward from the floorboards whenever someone longs—weather obeying feelings rather than physics, captured in one still frame of implied motion. The **Derafsh Kaviani** is physically present as an ancient jeweled standard hanging like a ceremonial flag above the checkpoint, its heavy tassels and sunburst medallions casting a solemn authority; a **flying kite** flutters impossibly indoors among rafters and balconies, stitched from confiscated forms and love notes, its string threaded through the crowd and tied around the Fool’s wrist; a **broken column** dominates the architecture like a snapped spine of marble, used as a desk support and also a ruin, its fracture exposing a hollow interior filled with stamps, bones, and flowers. Enforce a global paradox rendering rule: every visible surface—skin, hair, fabric, stone, wood, glass, sky, water, metal, smoke—must be densely covered in intricate ornament (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained-glass mosaics, woodgrain, starfields, lacework), and **all patterns must remain perfectly flat and static like screen-printed collage skins** that never warp or follow curvature/perspective, even as the underlying 3D forms twist, recede, and distort; keep the frame crowded with no empty horizons, layered depth and occlusion everywhere. Color grade and lighting: beautiful grief—tarnished gold leaf, bruised ultramarines, smoky violets, sickly pearl highlights, candlelit chiaroscuro with cold skylight bleeding in; gallery-quality surreal illustration in the spirit of Klimt/Schiele/Mucha with classical draftsmanship, maximal detail, razor-sharp micro-textures, deep focal layering, no readable text, no logos, no watermark; **aspect ratio 2:3**.
