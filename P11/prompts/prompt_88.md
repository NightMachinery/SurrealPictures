Vertical 2:3 gallery-quality surrealist illustration for an adult Dixit card, “frozen dream” mid-event: an endless district of interlocking staircases with no ground level, a claustrophobic labyrinth of flights, landings, balustrades, archways, bridges, trapdoors, and impossible switchbacks that fold into each other like a living puzzle, the entire frame crowded edge-to-edge (foreground/midground/background and corners all busy), air thick with suspended debris—paper sigils, fallen keys, domino tiles, broken mirrors, petals, moth wings, tiny bells, stair-number plaques—everything paused as if time has stopped at the exact instant of victorious elation; triumphant lighting and color grade: radiant golds and lapis blues with celebratory flare, high-contrast rim light like a coronation, glittering dust rays, warm highlights that feel like a win that hurts. At the center, two intertwined Tricksters (mythic, non-generic, socially charged): one a tall, androgynous fox-masked figure with a half-smile carved into porcelain, the other a jester-moth chimera with delicate human hands and a crown of antennae; they face each other in intimate rivalry, wrists gently bound together by a ribbon that is also a winding stair, each leaning as if about to kiss or betray, eyes suggesting both tenderness and theft; their bodies are partially nude in a classical, vulnerable, non-explicit way—more icon than flesh. The impossible defining physics: scale inversion made blatant—tiny staircase-citizens the size of fingernails haul a colossal Dharma Wheel like a sun through the alley of stairs, while the Tricksters casually hold a miniature city-district in one palm like a trinket; a monumental Cypress of Kashmar grows upside-down from a landing, its roots branching into chandeliers and doorways, yet its trunk is thin as a needle threading through arches; elsewhere, gigantic stair treads are etched with microscopic labyrinths containing whole processions, and a thimble-sized wheel turns a cathedral-sized mechanism. The Cypress of Kashmar and the Dharma Wheel are physically present and integral (carved into railings, worn as jewelry, embedded as architecture, held as a prize), but never explained—totems that feel remembered rather than understood. Global rendering rule (must be consistent across the entire image): every visible surface without exception—skin, hair, eyes, lips, nails, cloth, stone, metal, sky, smoke, water, glass—covered in intricate pattern layers (brocade, damask, lacework, thorn filigree, circuitry, woodgrain, starfields, stained-glass tracery), and these patterns must remain perfectly flat/static like collage or wallpaper (planar/UV-locked, no warping, no bending, no perspective following the 3D curvature), while the underlying forms are fully volumetric and can twist, recede, and distort; the paradox should feel hypnotic and unmistakable, especially on skin (living tapestry flesh). Style fusion: Klimt gilded ornament + Schiele charged anatomy + Mucha stained-glass line + classical oil-paint gravitas, ultra-high detail, layered mixed-media feel (gold leaf, ink, tempera, collage edges), sharp micro-texture everywhere, no empty space, no readable single narrative, no text, no watermark.
