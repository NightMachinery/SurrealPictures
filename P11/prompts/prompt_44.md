Vertical 2:3 tarot-card illustration, “Frozen Dream” moment in a funerary avenue lined with tiers of silent balconies, the entire frame claustrophobically crowded (no empty sky, no clean horizons): stacked planes like a collage diorama, vintage tarot framing with ornate borders and jammed margins (micro-vignettes, medallions, seals, tiny panels), poster-flat space that still suggests depth. At the avenue’s center: two mythic figures entangled in poised stillness—an Explorer (androgynous, salt-stained pilgrim, eyes like star charts, carrying a cracked compass that drips ink) and an Alchemist (tender, severe, haloed by glass apparatus, hands stained with gold leaf), their bodies partially nude in a way that reads as vulnerable and sacred rather than explicit; they lean toward each other as if about to kiss or exchange breath, but the moment is suspended—desire held like a prayer. Their skin, hair, and any fabric are overlaid with intricate patterns (brocade, damask, lacework, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained-glass tessellation, woodgrain, starfields), and **this is a global rendering law**: every visible surface is covered in rich pattern-skins that remain perfectly flat, unmoving, and unwarped—like screen-printed collage paper pasted onto 3D forms; patterns must NOT bend, stretch, or follow curvature even when bodies twist or architecture recedes (hypnotic paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form). The impossible defining feature: **edible architecture**—mausoleum facades made of marzipan marble, breadstone columns scored like pastry, balconies carved from crystallized sugar and dark chocolate, staircases of layered fruit leather and ash-dusted cake; bite-marks reveal cross-sections like geological strata of candy, bone, and fresco. The Explorer’s gloved mouth hovers near an archway as if tasting it; the Alchemist offers a spoon shaped like a key, or a vial of perfume that looks drinkable—passion rendered as consumption, communion, and alchemy. Woven physically into the scene: **comedy/tragedy masks** appear as balcony balustrades, funeral plaques, and hand-held objects—one mask cradled against a chest like a relic, another dangling from a ribbon, another half-melted into edible stone; expressions ambiguous (mockery that could be grief, sorrow that could be ecstasy). An **ouroboros** is present as a monumental ring (a serpent eating its tail) encircling the avenue like a broken halo-bridge, also echoed in smaller loops: a bracelet, a street drain, a wreath, a recurring border motif—suggesting endless desire and mourning without explaining it. Atmosphere: reverent sacred silence—candlelit dusk with cathedral-grade hush, soft gold and bruised ultramarine, incense haze, slow ash/petal fall frozen midair; lighting like Klimt gilding meets Schiele vulnerability meets Mucha ornament, with classical painterly authority and museum-grade detail. Fill corners with symbolic debris and offerings: cracked theatre tickets, rosary-beads of pomegranate seeds, alchemical diagrams, moths with map-wings, miniature balconies stacked like reliquaries, tiny hands sculpted from wax, mirror shards reflecting alternate expressions, a chalice spilling salt that becomes lace, distant figures implied only as patterned silhouettes behind balustrades. Make it polysemic and emotionally adult: tenderness that could be domination, devotion that could be hunger, grief that could be arousal—no single readable story, only an overdetermined, crowded visual riddle. Avoid modern text, logos, clean minimalism, blank gradients, or any empty negative space.
