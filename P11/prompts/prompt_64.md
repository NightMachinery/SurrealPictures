Vertical 2:3 collectible Dixit card illustration, “Frozen Dream” paused mid‑ritual in a harbor where **upside‑down ships** hang like drowned cathedrals above the water and their keels become arches; dense **lantern nets** sag between masts and chimneys like glowing constellations, overcrowding the sky with warm ember‑light. In the center foreground: **The Matchmaker** (mythic, androgynous, partially nude, tenderly imposing) stands barefoot on a jetty of barnacled marble, body and hair entirely overlaid with ornate **flat, unmoving** tapestry patterns (Klimt gold brocade + stained‑glass geometry + circuitry filigree), the pattern layer **never bending with anatomy**—a paradoxical collage skin on a volumetric form. They hold a **wilting bouquet** whose petals are dry as old letters; from the bouquet spill thin ribbon‑threads that stitch together small relics of **memory/nostalgia** (faded photographs, ticket stubs, pressed flowers, a cracked music box, pearls, a child’s glove, a tarnished key) floating in midair like a paused explosion. Facing them, inches away, **The Guardian** (towering, protective, half‑lighthouse/half‑beast, armored in ornamental plates and seaweed lace) braces one hand on an anchor that grows roots into the pier; the other hand gently cups the Matchmaker’s wrist as if stopping or blessing the offering—intimate, ambiguous, protective, possessive. **Facelessness is the broken law:** both figures have no faces at all—where their faces should be, there are impossible apertures: one is a smooth blank porcelain oval with a thin seam leaking lantern‑light; the other is an open “mask‑hole” revealing a living diorama of the same harbor in miniature (ships inverted within ships), creating a recursive dream. The **Simurgh** is physically present yet uncertain: a vast phoenix‑bird formed from braided lantern nets, stamped‑gold feathers, and torn map fragments, perched behind and above them like a guardian canopy; its wings are frozen mid‑unfurl and each feather contains tiny scenes (hands almost touching, a door half‑open, waves shaped like handwriting) that suggest five different stories without confirming any. Crowd every corner: fishermen‑saints made of rope and glass, floating buoys that resemble hearts, barnacles shaped like eyes, drifting petals, moths, ash, and glittering salt—foreground/midground/background packed with ornament and symbolic debris; no empty horizons. **Global rendering rule:** every surface (skin, cloth, wood, stone, water, sky, metal, smoke) is covered in richly intricate **perfectly flat, static** decorative pattern layers (damask, lacework, thorn filigree, starfields, woodgrain, illuminated‑manuscript marginalia), consistently non‑perspectival like cut paper or inlaid enamel, while the underlying 3D forms twist and recede normally—hypnotic contradiction throughout. Color grade: explosive vitality in jewel tones (vermillion, peacock teal, saffron, bruised violet) with gilded highlights and warm lantern bloom, yet undercut by nostalgic sepia ghosts and hairline cracks like aged varnish. Style: gallery‑quality surrealism merging classical oil glazing + gilt leaf + Art Nouveau linework (Mucha) + expressive anatomy tension (Schiele), ultra‑detailed, deep focus, sharp micro‑ornament, painterly texture, no text, no borders, no visible signature.
