Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist symbolist illustration (Klimt gold filigree + Schiele sinewy vulnerability + Mucha ornamental density, with classical painterly light; not a photo). In a storm-prairie crammed edge-to-edge with lightning-struck totems (splintered poles, antlered obelisks, prayer-wheel turbines, broken weather vanes, bone-and-porcelain pylons), a mythic pair occupies the tense center: an androgynous Therapist seated on a floating, threadbare couch that behaves like an altar, posture calm but heavy, face half-veiled in translucent porcelain; opposite, a Gardener kneels mid-prayer/mid-graft, hands turned to roots and pruning shears, offering a small, impossibly clean “seed of innocence” that glows like washed moonlight. Their interaction is intimate and ambiguous—one hand of the Therapist reaches to “listen” to the Gardener’s chest as if to a heartbeat; one root-hand of the Gardener gently tucks something bright into the Therapist’s ribcage as if planting gratitude itself. The defining broken-physics event is CONTAINMENT inverted and loudly visible: every vessel fails in a paradoxical way—bell jars, terrariums, teacups, medicine bottles, a therapist’s hourglass, even a tiny locket—each contains an entire storm prairie inside it that is larger than the object, spilling outward in perfectly frozen, mid-burst layers; simultaneously, the surrounding gale is trapped as a quiet, unmoving pool inside a single hovering droplet near center. The Eternal Flame of Atar is physically present as a sacred fire in a small brazier/portable altar held between them, yet the flame refuses its bowl: it blooms outward into a cathedral of fire while remaining eerily still, like a cut-paper silhouette of heat. A Heraldic Lion appears both as an embroidered coat-of-arms banner torn across the sky and as a semi-living stained-glass lion totem in the midground; its open mouth “houses” a second impossible container (a calm nursery-like room of light), while its mane fractures into lightning glyphs without forming readable text. Encode time as before-and-after echoes layered in one tableau: repeated outlines of the Therapist’s reaching arm in 3–5 positions, the Gardener’s planted seed shown simultaneously as seed / sprout / thorned vine / wilted blossom, and multiple shadows that disagree with the light direction, like overlapping memories. Atmosphere: overflowing thanks and childlike wonder—honeyed aurora light under bruised storm clouds, warm gold highlights on wet surfaces, prismatic rain suspended as beads; the mood is tender, ecstatic, and uneasy at once. MANDATORY global rendering rule: every single surface (skin, hair, cloth, couch fabric, lion, totems, clouds, rain, soil, metal, flame, shadows) is filled with intricate high-frequency patterns (brocade, damask, circuitry, lace, thorn filigree, stained glass leadwork, woodgrain, starfields), and these pattern “skins” remain perfectly FLAT, static, and unwarped like collage decals—never bending with form—creating a hypnotic paradox against the volumetric bodies and depth. Crowd every corner with meaningful debris (floating therapy notes as blank parchment, seeds like pearls, broken mirrors, surgical thread, pressed flowers, rosary-like garden beads, small animals rendered as ornamental emblems), no empty horizon, no text, no single readable narrative—only a dense, polysemic frozen dream frame.
