Aspect ratio 2:3 — A surreal, adult Dixit-card illustration in the spirit of Klimt + Schiele linework + Mucha ornament, rendered as a designed collage with stacked planes, mosaic borders, and poster-like framing: a cliffside elevator station perched above a dense “ocean” of clouds, but the entire station is turning inside-out in a frozen instant—walls peeled open like a glove, interior rooms exposed to the sky while exterior façades fold inward, staircases becoming ribs, the elevator cage blooming outward like an inverted lantern; everything is perfectly still, as if time paused mid-unfurl. In the center, backlit into near-silhouette, two mythic protagonists interlock: the Athlete & the Romanticist—an androgynous, statuesque sprinter-figure with calm, exhausted grace (laurel bruises, taped wrists, a runner’s stance held in suspension) gently supporting a softer, winged-poet figure (moth/angel hybrid, tender posture, mouth near the Athlete’s sternum as if listening for a heartbeat that isn’t there), their intimacy ambiguous (comfort, domination, rescue, farewell). The concept of Resonance/Echo manifests physically: concentric “sound” halos of objects repeat around them (duplicated gloves, roses, medals, love letters, teeth, bells, small mirrors) like visual reverberations; the cloud ocean ripples in perfectly spaced rings; the elevator cables multiply into parallel waveforms; distant silhouettes of the pair appear again and again in shrinking scale within framed apertures of the inside-out architecture, like memory copies. Totems are embedded, not displayed: a Faravahar wrought into the elevator gate and also hovering as a luminous emblem behind the figures’ heads; an hourglass strapped like a harness between them with sand flowing upward and outward into the air as suspended grains; a maypole rises from the platform as a central mast, its ribbons threading through beams, around ankles, into mouths of keyholes, binding foreground to background without explaining why. Foreground is an impossibly crowded still-life on the station’s lip: broken stopwatches, wet petals, a cracked perfume bottle, a boxing glove stuffed with handwritten vows, seashells shaped like ears, tiny anatomical hearts as lockets, elevator tokens, old photographs with faces rubbed away—every item casting calm, long shadows toward the viewer. Midground is dense with signage and relics (no readable text), mechanical filigree, hanging charms, stained-glass panes, and suspended debris that feels like confetti from a funeral and a wedding at once. Background: the cliff itself is hollowed and reversed, showing “interior sky” where rock should be; cloud-arches, distant lift-stations, and impossible bridges repeat like refrains, making the horizon crowded and claustrophobically serene. Global rendering rule (non-negotiable): every visible surface—skin, hair, fabric, metal, stone, cloud, sky, water—wears intricate pattern-skins (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, lace, woodgrain, starfields, stained glass), but these patterns remain perfectly flat and static like collage overlays locked to the picture plane (no warping, no stretching, no following form), creating a paradox against the volumetric bodies and architecture beneath. Color grade: deep calm serenity—cool twilight blues, pale gold leaf highlights, milky whites, soft backlight bloom—emotionally quiet yet charged; hyper-detailed, gallery-quality illustration, no empty space, no gore, no explicit sex, no minors, no text, no watermark.
