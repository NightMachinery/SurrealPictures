Vertical **2:3** gallery-quality surrealist illustration (Klimt gilded ornament + Schiele vulnerability + Mucha linework, classical oil-and-gouache with gold leaf, stained-glass glow), a **crowded clock-square bazaar where shadows are auctioned**: a baroque plaza of leaning clocktowers, cracked sundials, velvet awnings, balconies packed with masked onlookers, hourglasses like cathedral organs, auction blocks carved from marble metronomes; **foreground occlusion** is heavy—lace veils, thorny vines, wrought-iron railings, bead curtains, and torn silk banners partially blocking the view, creating layered partitions and peeking sightlines into corners stuffed with talismans (keys, pomegranates, empty bowls, bitten fruit, gavel splinters, rose thorns, falling clock hands, confetti-ash drifting like snow). Center composition is a **profile portrait split by a rigid architectural axis** (a tall stone column/doorframe/clock face bisecting the image): on one side, a mythic **musician** in strict profile—neither fully human nor beast (ivory-and-ink skin, antlered or moth-winged), playing an impossible instrument shaped like a ribcage-lyre; on the other side, **two lovers** fused in an intimate, ambiguous embrace—tender but tense, mouths near-but-not-touching, hands reaching as if starving, their bodies posed like a sacred icon and a struggle at once. The defining impossibility: **their shadows have autonomy**—multiple shadows detach, stand upright, and run the auction as elegant, predatory silhouettes (some tender, some cruel), holding catalog paddles, tugging leashes of darkness, lifting shadow-forms onto hooks like garments; meanwhile **objects are personified**—the **broken crown** (physically present, cracked and half-melted) wears a bruised expression, its shards behaving like fingers that clutch at bidders, while the **Eternal Flame of Atar** burns as a living entity (a bright, victorious flame that resembles a vigilant bird-serpent or haloed heart), illuminating faces with exultant radiance as if triumph itself is watching. The entire scene must embody **hunger/desire** through metaphor: empty vessels that bloom into mouths, fruit turning into eyes, bidding hands that reach through railings, lovers’ breath visible as ribbons being bartered, the square itself seeming to consume and birth longing. Lighting/color grade: **victorious elation**—radiant golds, hot ambers, jeweled reds, opalescent highlights like celebration at dawn—yet with undertow dread in the shadows’ intent. **Global rendering rule (crucial): every surface without exception (skin, hair, stone, water, sky, cloth, smoke, flame) is covered in dense intricate patterning—brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, lace, woodgrain, starfields, mosaic—BUT the patterns remain perfectly flat and static like collage cutouts/screen-printed decals: they do NOT warp, bend, stretch, or follow curvature or perspective, even on nude bodies; the 3D forms may twist and recede, yet the pattern “skins” stay locked and unmoving, creating a hypnotic paradox across the whole image.** No empty space anywhere; fill foreground/midground/background with micro-stories and symbolic debris; keep it polysemic and dreamlike—no captions, no readable text, no obvious single narrative, just a frozen impossible moment that feels half-remembered.
