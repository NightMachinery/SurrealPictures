Vertical **2:3** collectible Dixit card illustration, “**Frozen Dream**” paused mid-ritual: inside a **star-map monastery** (cloisters, apses, reliquaries, stairwells, bell towers) **suspended over an abyss of soft bioluminescent light**, the entire architecture **fractured into impossible floating slices and shards** (cubist displacement, glass-cut sections hovering inches apart, missing gravity, edges glowing like torn vellum), yet everything feels **unnaturally serene**—hushed, devotional, deep calm; a ring-shaped procession of **The Fool** as a **mythic, timeless ensemble** (androgynous jester-monk figures, some human, some gently animal-headed or mask-faced, tenderly interacting: one offers a **broken crown** like a sacrament, another steadies the giver by the wrist, another listens with forehead nearly touching theirs, a fourth smiles with quiet shame, a fifth looks outward as if about to step off the world), all caught in a cyclical rite suggested by **looping staircases, repeating mandalas, circular shadow-choirs, hourglasses that refill upward, braided rosaries forming an ouroboros**, and a **flying kite** made of translucent star-chart parchment drifting through the nave—its string threaded through fingers, bells, ribs of arches, and disappearing into the abyss below; crowd the frame to the corners with **astrolabes, incense smoke frozen into filigree, drifting debris of mosaic, pages of illuminated manuscripts, constellations pinned like insects, floating candles, miniature doors opening onto nothing, fragments of frescoed skin, cracked stained-glass halos, moths made of clockwork**; **global rendering rule (crucial): every visible surface—skin, hair, fabric, stone, sky, water, metal—covered in intensely intricate ornament (Klimt gold-leaf brocade, Art Nouveau lace, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, woodgrain, starfields, stained glass), and these pattern “skins” must remain perfectly flat and non-deforming like screen-printed collage decals (UV-locked, no warping with curvature) even as the 3D forms twist and recede**, creating a hypnotic paradox; tasteful artistic nudity allowed as living tapestry (vulnerability without explicit focus); lighting: tranquil nocturne with pale teal and moon-silver, quiet gold highlights, abyssal underglow; ultra-detailed, maximal density, no empty horizons, no single readable narrative—polysemic dream-symbol realism blending **Klimt / Schiele line tension / Mucha ornament / classical sacred painting** in a gallery-grade finish.
