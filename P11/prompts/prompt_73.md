Bird’s-eye diorama view (locked top-down/three-quarter miniature stage perspective), a **puppet-opera avenue that is also a living labyrinth**: velvet streets fold into maze-like balconies, impossible stairwells, proscenium arches nested inside each other, alleyways shaped like fretboards and shell spirals, every doorway leading into a smaller doorway; the entire frame **crowded** with tiny narrative clusters (lovers arguing in a matchbox theater, a judge weighed by feathers, a child offering a mask to an old god, a surgeon sewing a curtain to a sky), while **marionettes hang everywhere on visible strings** yet each puppet casts a **full-scale human shadow** on the paving stones—shadows performing different, more intimate or more violent gestures than their wooden bodies, hinting at shame, tenderness, power, grief, devotion; at the labyrinth’s soft center stand the mythic protagonists—**the Virgin & the Dreamer**—not literal saints but timeless archetypes: the Virgin as a serene, androgynous marionette-icon with cracked-gilded limbs and a halo made of theater rigging, holding a **Golden Egg** close to the chest like a secret promise; the Dreamer as a half-human, half-instrument somnambulist (ribcage like a harp, throat like an oboe) leaning toward the Virgin as if listening for confession, their foreheads almost touching, the space between them charged and unsaid; **Musical Materialization** dominates the physics of the frozen moment—sound has congealed into matter: notes become carved stair treads, chords crystallize into stained-glass bridges, sheet-music ribbons harden into labyrinth walls, a silent crescendo blooms into floating architecture; time is encoded as a **multiple-exposure illustration effect**—echoed hands, repeated head-tilts, sequential footprints, translucent afterimages of the Egg passing between them, strings vibrating in three positions at once—yet everything is held in reverent stillness, a sacred hush like a cathedral after the last hymn; the **Eternal Flame of Atar** burns impossibly without smoke inside a small ceremonial brazier integrated into the street like an altar-lantern (the flame’s shape repeating as a motif across the whole maze), and a **Burning Bush** grows from the opera’s masonry—thorny, luminous, aflame but unconsumed—its branches threaded with puppeteer strings and prayer beads; corners and air are thick with operatic debris (tickets, moths, keys, gears, lace gloves, cracked masks, tiny instruments, rose thorns, wax tears, confetti like ash), with no empty sky—only layered curtains, balconies, and labyrinthine ornament; **GLOBAL RENDERING LAW:** every surface without exception—skin, hair, cloth, wood, stone, flame, foliage, sky—covered in hyper-intricate patterns (Klimt-like gold brocade, Schiele-like scratch filigree, Mucha lace, circuitry, damask, thornwork, starfields, stained-glass tessellation), but these patterns must remain **perfectly flat, screen-printed, collage-like, non-deforming, not wrapping around form, not following perspective or curvature** (as if each object is a cutout wearing an unmoving decorative skin), creating a hypnotic paradox between volumetric bodies and planar ornament; lighting: **reverence / sacred silence**, candle-gold and deep ultramarine with soft chiaroscuro, incense-like haze, museum-grade detail, surreal but classical draftsmanship; no text, no logos; gallery-quality adult Dixit ambiguity; **aspect ratio 2:3**.
