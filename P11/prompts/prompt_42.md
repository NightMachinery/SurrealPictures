A 2:3 vertical, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (Klimt + Schiele line tension + Mucha ornament, with classical glazing and gold-leaf luminosity), designed as an adult Dixit “Frozen Dream” Rorschach: **worm’s-eye view** from inside a **carnival-circus necropolis** where mausoleums are striped like big tops and gravestones are carousel horses; towering foreground ornament crowds the lens—baroque wrought-iron filigree, lace banners, ticket-stub confetti, cracked mirror shards, bead chains, moth wings, rosary-like carnival bulbs—everything stacked in flat poster-planes like a **vintage tarot card** with an ornate, crowded border of tiny vignettes (masked mourners, paper crowns, small reliquaries, miniature rides, bones arranged as party favors), no empty corners, no horizon. Center-frame, looming upward: a mythic duo locked in an intimate standoff—**the Healer** (androgynous, partly nude, skin like a living tapestry) kneels on a tomb-lid altar, palms open, holding a **hearth fire** in a shallow ceremonial bowl that glows warm and impossible; the flame behaves like a small domestic hearth torn loose from a house, complete with ember-bed and phantom chimney draft. Beside/behind them, **the Ninja** (non-human, elegant, quiet predator-priest in layered shadow-silk) perches weightlessly on a crooked obelisk, half-embracing and half-guarding the Healer, one hand poised as if to cut a ribbon or a throat, the other offering a stitched garland of luminous tickets; their faces nearly touch—tenderness or threat, rescue or abduction, invitation or punishment—unclear. The defining broken-logic **literal metaphor**: **celebration is resurrection**—every burst of confetti is also funerary ash, and each ash-flake becomes a tiny mask or tooth or flower midair; applause is visible as concentric stained-glass ripples that lift coffins like balloons; streamers pull upward on headstones as if they are helium-bound gifts; the necropolis itself “throws a party” by opening crypt doors like mouths exhaling carnival music you can see as paper ribbons. Physically present totems: **Zahhak’s shoulder serpents** emerge from the Healer’s shoulders (or from the Ninja’s mantle) as two ornate, watchful snakes made of jeweled tubing and grave-vine, drinking the hearth fire’s light rather than blood; their gaze points the viewer around the frame like living arrows. Phosphor **ticket booths** glow toxic-mint and electric-cyan throughout the midground like shrine-lanterns, illuminating fog that sparkles with mica and bone dust; childlike wonder color-grade (opalescent teals, warm honey-golds, candy-amber highlights) with chiaroscuro pockets of dread. **Global rendering rule (mandatory):** every surface—skin, hair, fabric, stone, fog, flame, metal, sky—covered in hyper-intricate pattern layers (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lace), and these patterns remain perfectly flat and unwarped like collage decals or silkscreen cutouts, never following curvature even on bodies; 3D forms can twist dramatically underneath while the pattern “skins” stay locked and static, creating a hypnotic paradox everywhere. Composition feels designed, not naturalistic: mosaic stacking, diptych echoes inside the border, theatrical poster symmetry that still reads as a dream. No readable text, no single clear story—only dense, sensual, vulnerable ambiguity: festivity as healing, hunting, mourning, and desire paused at the exact moment before it becomes either salvation or catastrophe.
