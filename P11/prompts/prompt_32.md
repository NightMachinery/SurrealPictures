Vertical **2:3** “Frozen Dream” tableau, gallery-quality surrealist illustration with fin‑de‑siècle **Symbolist / Art‑Nouveau** elegance (Klimt‑like gold intimacy, Schiele‑like vulnerability, Mucha‑like ornament) fused with classical painterly light; **the entire frame is crowded** (foreground/midground/background packed, no empty sky). Inside a colossal **transparent reliquary vessel** (half jar, half cathedral apse) physics is broken: impossible **containment**—a stormy sea, a starfield, and a quiet bedroom all nested inside one another like Russian dolls—while **material transmutation** ripples through the still air: glass becomes skin, paper becomes water, brass becomes pollen, ink becomes smoke, and every transformation is paused mid‑event (action implied, motion frozen). Center: **The Inventor**—a mythic, androgynous clockwork scribe with oil‑black fingertips and a tender, exhausted posture—leans forward as if finally exhaling; opposite, **The Beloved**—a timeless human‑animal hybrid (deer‑crowned, softly nude, icon‑like) stands close enough to be dangerous yet gentle, one hand hovering over the Inventor’s chest as if weighing a verdict, the other hand releasing it. Between them: a **love letter** (an unaddressed envelope with a broken wax seal) is being “forgiven” into light—its pages unravel into moths, petals, and tiny keys, with **no readable text**, only dense abstract calligraphy‑patterns; the Inventor offers a **lyre of Orpheus** that is cracked yet re‑strung with hair‑fine threads that glow, and the Beloved’s touch turns the fracture lines into gold (forgiveness as repair without erasure). In the background, the **Cypress of Kashmar** rises as an axis mundi through the vessel—an ancient cypress that grows **upside‑down and right‑side‑up at once**, roots in constellations and branches in marble, needles made of miniature letters and beads; around it, shattered architectural ribs float like gentle debris, chains slacken into vines, padlocks bloom into flowers, and heavy stones hang weightless—**relief** made visible as gravity politely lets go. Lighting/color grade: warm dawn‑gold with cool turquoise shadows, soft haloed backlight like a lifted burden; dust motes, lace scraps, clock gears, rose thorns, glass shards, feathers, and tiny mirrored masks drift in every corner. **Global rendering rule (non‑negotiable): every visible surface—skin, hair, water, stone, metal, clouds, fabric, wood—must be covered in intricate flat decorative pattern layers (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, starfields, lace), and these patterns must remain perfectly static and unwarped, like screen‑printed collage cutouts laid over the scene (orthographic decal effect), never bending with curvature or perspective even on bodies and waves; volumetric forms can twist and recede underneath while the pattern “skin” stays flat.** Ultra‑detailed, paradoxical, emotionally intelligent, polysemic, no captions, no modern typography, no blank space.
