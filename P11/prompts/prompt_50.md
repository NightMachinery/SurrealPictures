**Aspect ratio 2:3.** A crowded, gallery-quality surrealist illustration for an adult Dixit card: inside a **sea-cave court lit by phosphor waves**, the viewer is tilted into the scene at a **pronounced Dutch angle**, where every architectural line becomes a **cascading diagonal**—broken stair-reefs, ribbed columns of salt, chandeliers of barnacles, and judge’s benches carved from shipwreck doors. At the center stands an ageless **Guardian** (part coral idol, part weary attendant, part sea-king), tall and intimate at once, torso slightly bowed as if listening to a confession; its hands hover mid-gesture over a **Swarm** that orbits it like heirs around a will—dozens of small beings that are simultaneously moths, paper cutouts, and miniature masked faces, each carrying a different expression they cannot fully own. The Guardian’s chest is opened like a reliquary (not gory—iconic), and inside is an impossible inheritance: a nest of keepsakes, teeth-like pearls, childlike toys turned ceremonial, and a thin thread of genealogy that climbs the cavern walls like a vine made of handwriting; the Swarm keeps trying to enter the Guardian, while the Guardian keeps trying to let go, creating a paused, tender stalemate. The **emotional weather** is explicit and physical: **laughter** falls as bright confetti hail, **shame** drifts as pink-gray fog that clings to ankles, **grief** rolls in as heavy ink-rain that lands as perfectly shaped black beads, and **ecstasy** flashes as prism lightning that illuminates the court like stained glass; none of it obeys gravity—each emotion has its own direction. **Objects are personified**: a **half-burned candle** sits on the throne’s armrest like a nervous witness, its wax forming a small pleading mouth and its flame appearing in **multiple exposures** (three or four offset flames showing different “moments” of the same breath), while nearby a **masquerade mask** is embedded into the stone like a living crest—its ribbon tendrils gently tugging at passing Swarm-members as if choosing who belongs. Encode time as a **multiple-exposure effect within one still**: repeated silhouettes of the Swarm in sequential positions, echo-hands of the Guardian a fraction apart, overlapping wave-creases on the cave floor like stuttered memory, all frozen mid-event yet insisting something just happened and is about to happen again. **Global rendering rule:** every visible surface—skin, stone, water, smoke, hair, fabric, shell—must be densely covered in intricate ornament (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, woodgrain, lacework, starfields, stained-glass tessellation), and **the patterns remain perfectly flat and unmoving like collage paper or screenprint**, never warping with form; the bodies and architecture can twist volumetrically beneath these static pattern-skins, creating a hypnotic paradox everywhere. Color grade: whimsical, phosphorescent jewel tones (sea-green, opal blue, candle-amber, bruised violet) with playful absurdity in the details (tiny courtroom signs written in nonsense alphabets, ceremonial rubber ducks as sacred icons, solemn crabs wearing signet rings), yet emotionally adult—vulnerability, power, longing, and contradiction in every gaze and gesture. Fill foreground/midground/background with dense micro-stories (floating letters, snapped strings, heirloom lockets, coral rosaries, broken mirrors reflecting different “versions” of the Guardian), no empty horizons, no single readable plot—only a half-remembered dream that feels personally familiar. Style fusion: Klimt × Schiele line tension × Mucha ornament × classical painterly lighting, surrealist symbolism, exquisitely detailed, illustration (not photo).
