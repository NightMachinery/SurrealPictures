Vertical 2:3 collectible Dixit card illustration, “Frozen Dream” frame: in a cathedral-like salon that is also a body and also a banquet, two mythic Romantists (androgynous lovers, timeless, more icon than human) hover mid-embrace without touching—one leaning forward as if to kiss through air, the other pulling away with a tender, guilty smile; their nudity is classical and vulnerable (no explicit sex), skin rendered as a living tapestry. **Global paradox rule:** every surface in the image—skin, hair, fabric, marble, smoke, fruit, water, sky—wears an intricate *perfectly flat* ornamental “skin” (brocade/damask/stained-glass circuitry/thorn filigree/lace/starfields/woodgrain) that stays locked to the picture plane like collage paper or a decal sheet, **never** wrapping, stretching, or following 3D curvature, even while the underlying forms twist and recede in deep perspective. Theme of hunger/desire expressed as architecture that “wants”: mouths in cornices half-open like doors, tongues as velvet drapery, empty plates reflecting wet lips, pomegranates split like hearts, grapes like bruises, silver cutlery shaped like keys; longing is everywhere yet never consummated. **Portal displacement is overt and defining:** multiple rectangular portals slice through the room like misaligned windows; the **feast table** passes through them in impossible segments (a single table fractured into three locations at once—one end in the foreground, the center suspended in a portal midair, the far end vanishing into a night-sky corridor), with chairs half-phased, place settings duplicated, wine pouring upward into a different gravity. At the table’s center: a **half-burned candle** frozen mid-drip, wax droplets hovering like pearls; beside it, a small fire-temple brazier holding the **Eternal Flame of Atar**, a steady sacred flame that seems to illuminate *without casting consistent shadows*, its light felt more than logically seen. Atmosphere: transcendent ecstasy—opalescent gold-leaf glow, prismatic halos, chromatic bloom as if stained glass is breathing; light rays behave like ribbons and musical staffs, yet the scene remains perfectly still. Crowd the frame with meaningful debris: floating lace napkins like moth wings, broken mirrors showing different emotional versions of the lovers, petals that resemble burnt paper, tiny cherubs made of clockwork and embroidery unspooling thread into constellations, seashells filled with ink, a black dog made of velvet night watching from a portal’s edge, hands carved into the banister reaching toward fruit they can’t grasp. Corners packed with micro-narratives that never resolve: a goblet holding a miniature ocean with a drowning crown; a plate that is also a compass; a curtain that is also a map of veins; distant figures behind another portal applauding silently as if witnessing a wedding or an execution. Style: gallery-quality surrealist figurative illustration with Klimt/Schiele/Mucha ornamentation and classical oil-paint gravitas, razor-sharp detail across foreground/midground/background, deep focus, no text, no captions, no watermark, no signature—an emotionally intelligent, polysemic riddle of desire, shame, tenderness, and bliss.
