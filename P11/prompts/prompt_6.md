Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration (adult Dixit, polysemic, no single narrative), a crowded cliffside elevator station perched above a churning ocean of clouds: rusted Art Nouveau ironwork fused with temple stone, ticket gates grown into ribcage arches, cables like harp strings, every inch packed with relics (keys, veils, medicine labels, love letters, prayer beads, tiny suitcases, broken metronomes, petals, teeth-like elevator buttons) suspended midair as if time has been pinned. Center frame: a mythic Idol and a Therapist locked in an intimate, ambiguous exchange—The Idol: towering, androgynous, partially nude yet non-explicit, posed like a devotional statue caught mid-step, one foot already “elsewhere”; their skin is a living tapestry of gold-leaf brocade and starfield mosaics, face serene but split by hairline cracks repaired with luminous kintsugi seams (resilience as visible mending). From the Idol’s shoulders coil Zahhak’s twin serpents—simultaneously living and ornamental, their bodies made of jeweled circuitry and thorn filigree, heads hovering near the Idol’s ears as if whispering counsel or temptation; their gaze feels protective and predatory at once. The Therapist: a calm, non-human attendant—part clinical, part saint—wearing a ceremonial coat patterned like stained-glass medical diagrams, hands gentle and precise; one hand steadies the Idol’s sternum, the other offers a hand-mirror that reflects not the scene but a different sky, as if listening becomes a portal. Above them, a wedding canopy (chuppah) is improvised from elevator cables, lace veils, and fractured skylight panes, held aloft by unseen tension; it reads as blessing, trap, and stage curtain simultaneously, casting prismatic confetti shadows. The defining impossible event (portal displacement): the elevator doors are open, and the interior is not an interior—multiple incompatible worlds occupy the same rectangular doorway at once; objects and architecture are “misregistered” across space: half a staircase pours out of the elevator into open air, a section of cloud-ocean rises inside the cabin like a vertical waterfall, a distant ballroom chandelier hangs in the station’s foreground, and the Idol’s trailing limb/garment/halo is cleanly displaced into another location while still attached, as if cut-and-pasted by reality; the portal seams are crisp, collage-like, and wrong. Triumph lighting: victorious elation, sunrise-gold and electric turquoise rim light, celebratory glare like a coronation—yet with undertones of ache; airborne dust becomes glittering confetti, the clouds below glow as if applauding. Global rendering rule (non-negotiable): every surface—skin, hair, stone, metal, cloud, water, fabric—covered in intricate flat decorative pattern layers (brocade, damask, lacework, woodgrain, stained glass, star maps, circuit etching, thorn arabesques) that remain perfectly static and planar, never warping to form; the 3D shapes can twist and recede, but the pattern “skins” stay locked like a cutout collage, creating a hypnotic paradox everywhere. Composition density mandate: fill all corners with micro-scenes that imply strength through survival—patched girders, stitched banners, scarred masonry, re-tied cables—without explaining why; freeze-frame tension, maximal detail, Klimt/Schiele/Mucha opulence meets classical oil realism, razor-sharp textures, no empty sky, no clean horizon, emotionally intelligent ambiguity.
