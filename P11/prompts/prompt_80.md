A 2:3 vertical, gallery-quality surrealist illustration for an adults-only Dixit card: inside a collapsed celestial boudoir-temple (part ballroom, part crypt, part sea-cave), two mythic lovers hover in a suspended embrace at the exact instant before contact—one figure half-statue/half-animal (antlered, androgynous), the other a luminous, scarred muse with calm, exposed vulnerability; between their faces floats an oval hand-mirror like a sacred icon, but its “reflection” is not a reflection: it shows their bodies as a different species, different age, different power dynamic, as if memory has rewritten them. The entire world is performing entropy as a ritual—architectural ribs unravel into threads, frescoes flake into glittering ash, pearls become sand, rose petals turn to rust midair, a chandelier’s crystals quietly decompose into moths—yet everything is frozen in one impossible still frame. Break physics loudly through literal metaphor and synesthesia: visible music pours from the Lyre of Orpheus (present, real, held like a relic) as dense ribbon-like soundwaves that become stained-glass color and then solidify into aromatic smoke; the lovers’ breath is seen as calligraphy that crumbles into dust; touch becomes light: where their fingers almost meet, a bright wound of bliss opens and leaks prismatic warmth into the room. A friendship bracelet (clearly recognizable) binds them and also stitches through the scene like a connective nerve—threaded through columns, looped around the mirror’s rim, snagged on floating debris—suggesting intimacy, obligation, nostalgia, or betrayal depending on the viewer. A Cerberus occupies the lower midground as a guardian of thresholds: three heads made of different materials (porcelain, obsidian, and flowering vine), calm rather than snarling, each head gazing at a different “truth” (the lovers, the mirror, the lyre), its leash braided from the same bracelet thread. Crowd every corner: drifting torn sheet music, broken icons, hairpins, keys, fruit bruising into constellations, lace curtains turning into seafoam, tiny votive flames trapped in glass tears, hands carved into the walls reaching but never touching. Ecstasy as transcendent bliss: opalescent golds and fevered ambers with cool aurora highlights, backlit halos, devotional glow like sacred eroticism without explicit sex—tenderness and dread coexisting. **Global rendering rule (crucial): every surface—skin, hair, stone, sky, water, fabric, metal—covered edge-to-edge with intricate patterns (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework), but these pattern “skins” remain perfectly flat, static, collage-like and NEVER warp or follow form; the 3D volumes beneath can twist and recede, creating a hypnotic paradox of flat ornament over sculptural depth.** Ultra-detailed, no empty space, no readable single story, no text, no watermark; Klimt × Schiele emotional intensity with Mucha ornament and classical painterly lighting, sharp focus with layered micro-details across foreground/midground/background.
