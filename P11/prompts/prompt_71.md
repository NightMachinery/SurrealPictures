Vertical 2:3, gallery-quality surrealist illustration in a fin‑de‑siècle symbolist / Vienna Secession + Art Nouveau tapestry aesthetic (gold-leaf glints, Schiele-like vulnerable line, Mucha-like ornamental density), a perfume bazaar under mirrored domes that feels endless and intimate at once: concentric circular framing dominates the composition—nested rings of arched stalls, circular rugs, haloed lantern chains, bottle-mouth apertures, and mirrored oculi all orbit a central “frozen dream” tableau. In the exact center, the Lovers and the Ferryman form a quiet triangle of contact: two androgynous lovers (mythic, ageless, tender, partially nude in an artistic icon-like way) lean forehead-to-forehead as if sharing a single breath; their hands are almost clasped but not quite, a gap like an unhealed seam. Between/behind them stands the Ferryman—nonhuman, serene, priestly, with an oar that is also a perfume pipette and a boatman’s pole; from the Ferryman’s shoulders unfurl Zahhak’s two serpents, not snarling but calm, draped like living stoles, their tongues tasting the air for grief, their bodies coiling into perfect circles that echo the framing rings. The scene embodies healing/recovery through architecture and matter: cracks in mirror tiles are repaired with luminous kintsugi veins; torn silk awnings are stitched with hair-thin threads of light; a wilting bouquet (held by one lover, petals browned and heavy) appears in multiple-exposure echoes—one ghost image droops, another releases petals, another is impossibly reassembled—suggesting recovery as layered time rather than a single event. The impossible defining twist is Mechanical Nature made blatant: orchids of brass and mother-of-pearl bloom from gear-housings; vines are copper tubes with valves exhaling incense; moths are clockwork filigree; raindrops are tiny mirrored beads that click into place midair; spilled perfume becomes a river of translucent cogs and pollen, flowing upward and sideways in stillness as if gravity is optional. A wishing well is embedded in the bazaar floor like a dark iris at the lovers’ feet—its stone rim crowded with coins, rings, teeth, prayer beads, tiny bottles, and folded notes; the well’s water is a perfectly still vertical sheet, yet in multiple exposure it shows slow lifts of hands, falling coins, rising reflections, never resolving which direction is true. Crowd every layer: foreground shards of cut crystal form mandalas; midground vendors without faces (only patterned veils) hold atomizers like censers; background mirrored domes repeat the central triad infinitely with slight variations, like memories misremembered. Atmosphere is deep calm and contentment—soft opal light, muted teal/ivory/antique gold, incense haze, no harsh contrast—yet emotionally adult: tenderness edged with shame and relief, ecstasy muted into serenity, dread domesticated into ritual. Global rendering rule: every surface without exception—skin, hair, fabric, stone, glass, water, sky—must be filled with intricate flat decorative pattern (brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework), and these pattern skins remain perfectly planar and unmoving like collage cutouts/decoupage, refusing to warp or follow the 3D curvature beneath, creating a hypnotic paradox between volumetric forms and static ornament; include subtle multi-exposure trails/echo outlines within the single still; extremely dense detail in corners; no empty space; no text or watermark.
