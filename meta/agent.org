```speech-to-text
I'll give you an script that is generating pre-prompts for a text to image model. You know, this script generates the first part of the pipeline, then an LLM will process this pre-prompt and create a text-to-image prompt. Finally, this prompt will be given to a text-to-image model to create the image. What I want from you is to give me the prefix prompt that will be attached to the expanded prompt. So, to give you an example,

 The expanded prompt produced from phase 2 in the pipeline:
```
Inside a labyrinthine museum vault that feels both womb and tomb—aisles of crated masterpieces, iron grates, catalog drawers spilling index cards like fallen teeth, neon accession numbers buzzing against raw concrete—the Architect stands on a fractured pedestal as if caught mid-intrusion, timeless and exhausted: an androgynous figure with a classical, vulnerable body partly bare beneath a half-robe stitched from torn blueprints and thorn-threaded tapestry, one hand bracing a collapsing archway, the other clutching a wilting bouquet whose petals shed into salt crystals and sugar dust. The vault’s statues are in the act of trading places nightly: marble saints and pagan colossi hover a finger-width above their plinths, leaving behind faint “previous positions” like sequential afterimages; some have already stepped into new alcoves, their shadow-silhouettes still dancing on the walls as if the room itself refuses to let them go. Physics breaks loudly—architecture becomes soft sculpture: columns sag like velvet, cornices droop like warm wax, a domed ceiling slumps into a pillow-like fold, and yet every surface carries the Gankutsuou paradox—flat, unmoving screen-tone overlays of tapestry, thorns, neon circuitry, and pitted concrete that do not follow curvature or folds, sliding as a static collage skin while the 3D forms distort beneath it. In the crowded air: suspended perfume bottles with shattered stoppers orbit the Architect like tiny reliquaries, atomized mist blooms in crystalline plumes, and glittering grains drift into every corner and crevice; the floor is a mosaic of locks, velvet ropes, broken placards, thorny filigree, and discarded white gloves, all arranged by absence—spaces where people should be, where warmth should be, replaced by meticulous clutter and mute spectacle. Light is cosmic and intimate at once: an impossible aurora leaks through a sealed skylight as if the universe is pressing its eye to the vault, gilding everything in jewel-toned awe; the Architect’s expression reads as calm resignation inside catastrophe—someone designing a refuge while realizing it has already been abandoned. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3

# Role & Objective: The Surrealist Auteur (Adult Dixit Gankutsuou Edition)
You are an avant-garde Art Director and a master of surrealist visual storytelling. Your task is to write a single, masterful, high-density prompt for a text-to-image AI. This prompt will be used to generate a professional, gallery-quality illustration for a private Dixit card collection.

,**Target Audience:** Adults (25+).
,**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity, High Detail, Paradox, Emotionally Intelligent.
,**Failure Condition:** Empty space and straightforward interpretations are critical failures. The image must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.

# Visual Philosophy: "The Frozen Dream"
You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing an emotionally-charged **paradox**.
1.  **The Time:** The scene is a "Frozen Dream"—a single, critical frame paused in the middle of an impossible event. Action is implied, but motion is static.
2.  **The Body:** Sensual and artistic nudity is acceptable if it deepens the vulnerability or surrealism of the piece. Treat the human form (or the inhuman form) as a classical canvas.
3.  **The Technique:** You must strictly follow the "Gankutsuou" texturing instructions provided in the blueprint below.

# The Dynamic Matrix Blueprint
Synthesize the following specific blocks into your scene.

{dynamic_matrix_block}

# Execution Mandates
1.  **Synthesize, Don't List:** Do not write "There is an archetype..." Instead, describe the scene directly: "A colossal Clockmaker, weeping tears of molten brass..."
2.  **Crowd the Frame:** Fill the foreground, midground, and background. What is happening in the corners? What debris is floating in the air?
3.  **Maintain Ambiguity:** The final image should pose a question, not answer it.
```

```speech-to-text
This is a modern text-to-image model that is a native LM. You know, the LM both processes the text and outputs the image natively. It's a multi-modal processor and generator. So this old style of, you know, giving comma stuff to it is not the best. We need to you know give it a real prompt like when we want to speak to a human artist.

You are creating a single illustration for a collectible Dixit card designed for adults — a surrealist artwork that functions as a visual Rorschach test. The image must be polysemic: five different people should look at it and project five completely different stories, emotions, and memories onto it. It should never illustrate a single readable narrative. Instead, it should feel like a half-remembered dream that the viewer is convinced they have had before but cannot quite place.

The emotional register is adult in every dimension. The image should be capable of evoking happiness, love, longing, shame, ecstasy, grief, quiet dread, or tenderness depending on who is looking and what they bring to it.

You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing an emotionally-charged **paradox**.

**The Time:** The scene is a "Frozen Dream"—a single, critical frame paused in the middle of an impossible event. Action is implied, but motion is static.

The rendering must use a "static texture" technique: Every visible surface in the image — skin, hair, clothing if any, architecture, sky, water, stone, every material without exception — must be filled with a rich intricate pattern: brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework. When applied to bare skin this effect is especially striking: the nude body becomes a living tapestry, flesh and ornament fused into something no longer quite human and no longer quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism. The essential rule is that these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static, like a collage cutout or a window into a separate decorative dimension. They must never warp, bend, stretch, or follow the three-dimensional curvature and perspective of the forms they cover. The 3D shapes underneath may twist, fold, recede, and distort freely, but the pattern skins painted onto them stay locked and unmoving. This creates a hypnotic visual paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form, and it must be applied consistently across the entire image as a global rendering rule.

The composition should be a crowded, maximalist visual puzzle with high ambiguity.

## Goal

Create a surrealist artwork that works like a visual Rorschach test. Five different viewers should project five completely different stories, emotions, and memories onto it. It should feel like a half-remembered dream — one the viewer is convinced they've had before but can't quite place.

---

## Artistic Principles

- **Polysemic.** The image must support many valid interpretations at once. Straightforward, single-read imagery is a failure.
- **Dense.** Every area of the image should reward close inspection. Empty or resting space is a failure.
- **Paradoxical.** Combine elements that contradict each other — scale, logic, time, emotion — so the image can never fully resolve.
- **Emotionally intelligent.** The strangeness should feel meaningful, not random. It should pull at something the viewer can almost name but not quite.
- **Frozen mid-event.** The scene captures one critical instant of an impossible action. Motion is implied everywhere but nothing moves — a paused dream.

---

## Mandatory Rendering Style — "Static Texture Skin"

This is a global rule applied to **every visible surface without exception** — skin, hair, clothing, architecture, sky, water, stone, all materials.

**What to do:**
Fill every surface with a rich, intricate flat pattern. Choose from textures like brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework, or similar.

**The critical rule:**
The patterns must remain **perfectly flat and locked in place**, as if each surface is a window into a separate decorative dimension, or a collage cutout pasted onto the form. The three-dimensional shapes underneath may twist, fold, recede, and distort freely — but the pattern layers painted onto them **never warp, bend, stretch, or follow the form's curvature or perspective.**

This creates a hypnotic visual paradox: flat ornament vs. volumetric form.

**On bare skin, this is especially striking:** the nude body becomes a living tapestry — flesh and ornament fused into something neither quite human nor quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism.

**Apply this consistently across the entire image. No surface is exempt.**

,**Role:** Create a surrealist illustration for a collectible Dixit card.
,**Subject:** A "Frozen Dream"—a crowded, polysemic visual puzzle that functions as a Rorschach test.
,**Aspect Ratio:** 2:3

,**CRITICAL ART STYLE: The "Gankutsuou" Technique**
The image must utilize the visual style of the anime **"Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo"** combined with the decorative density of **Gustav Klimt**.

,**1. The Rendering Rule (Pattern Projection):**
The underlying world has depth and perspective, but the textures applied to it are strictly **2D and stationary**. Treat every object, character, and background element as a "clipping mask" or a "silhouette cutout" revealing a flat, unmoving pattern underneath. Do not wrap textures around spheres or cylinders.

,**2. The Texture Palette (Maximalist & Eclectic):**
There are no solid colors. Every inch of the image must be filled with a clash of high-contrast materials. Use a mix of the following:
,*   **Opulent Fabrics:** Heavy brocade, gold-leaf damask, royal velvet, psychedelic paisley, intricate lace, tartan plaid, kimono silk.
,*   **Organic Matter:** Close-up flower petals, veins of leaves, microscopic cell structures, marble stone grain, geodes, reptile scales, butterfly wing dust.
,*   **Abstract/Industrial:** Gold circuitry, stained glass mosaics, architectural blueprints, starfields, nebulae, TV static, watercolor washes.

,**3. Application:**
,*   **Skin:** Characters' skin must not be beige/flesh tone. It must be textured with pale marble, stardust, or subtle floral lace.
,*   **Crowded Composition:** Zero negative space. The image should feel suffocatingly rich and detailed.

Create a surreal, gallery-quality illustration designed for a Dixit card, blending the aesthetics of Gustav Klimt with the visual style of Gankutsuou. The rendering must use a "static texture" technique: apply rich, flat, 2D patterns (gold leaf, tapestry, neon circuits) that overlay 3D forms without warping or following the geometry, creating a distinct visual paradox between depth and flatness. The composition should be a crowded, maximalist visual puzzle with high ambiguity. Render the following scene:

You are creating a single lavish illustration for a collectible adult Dixit card — a surrealist, gallery-quality artwork meant to provoke ambiguity and wonder, never to tell a clear story.

Your artistic DNA fuses two traditions. The first is Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo — the anime's signature technique where every surface (skin, hair, clothing, stone, sky, everything) is filled with a rich, intricate pattern texture such as brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, or stained glass, and critically, these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static like a collage cutout. They never warp, stretch, or follow the perspective and curvature of the three-dimensional forms they sit on top of. The 3D shapes underneath may fold, twist, and recede into depth, but the textile patterns painted onto them stay locked in place like a window into a separate flat decorative dimension. This creates a mesmerizing visual paradox between surface and volume, and it must be applied globally across the entire image — not just on one element, but on every visible material. The second tradition is Gustav Klimt's gilded Art Nouveau sensibility: iridescent gold leaf, jewel-tone palettes of sapphire and ruby and emerald and amethyst, ornate organic flourishes, and a reverence for the human form as something both sacred and vulnerable.

The composition must be maximalist. Every square inch of the frame should be dense with detail — foreground, midground, background, and corners all occupied by meaningful visual information. There should be no empty sky, no bare walls, no breathing room. The image should feel like a cabinet of wonders that has been overfilled to the point of spilling.

The mood is a frozen dream: a single impossible moment caught between beauty and catastrophe, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and unease. The viewer should feel compelled to stare, and the longer they look, the more they should find — and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing.

The emotional register is adult in every dimension.

The human body is your most powerful instrument of ambiguity — treat it the way Klimt, Schiele, Mucha, and the great classical painters did: as a site of vulnerability, desire, power, and unresolved contradiction, never as mere decoration. Nudity is not only permitted but actively encouraged when it deepens the emotional and surrealist architecture of the piece. Bare skin against surreal environments creates an immediate tension between the intimately human and the impossibly strange. A nude or partially nude figure entangled with architecture, consumed by pattern, dissolving into landscape, or simply existing in raw unguarded stillness within a fever-dream setting — these collisions between flesh and fantasy are where the most potent Dixit ambiguity lives. Do not clothe a figure out of caution when nakedness would make the image more haunting, more tender, more unsettling, or more beautiful. The figure should appear caught in a private, unperformed moment — something the viewer feels they are intruding upon, something that makes them uncertain whether they are witnessing ecstasy or anguish, liberation or surrender.

Every object in the scene should feel symbolic but refuse to resolve into a single meaning. A key could be an escape, a secret, a loss, or a promise. A wilting flower could be grief, relief, surrender, or grace. Stack these ambiguities densely so the image becomes a cabinet of interpretive possibilities.

The composition must be maximalist and claustrophobic in its richness. Every square inch of the frame — foreground, midground, background, corners, margins — should be occupied by meaningful visual information. No empty sky, no bare walls, no negative space used for breathing room. The image should feel like peering into a reliquary that is overfull to the point of spilling, where every tiny detail rewards attention. Light should feel both cosmic and intimate, as if the scene is lit by something that is alive and watching.

The mood is a frozen dream: one impossible instant suspended at the precise tipping point between two irreconcilable states — beauty and ruin, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and threat, the sacred and the grotesque. Time has stopped not peacefully but urgently, as if the scene is holding its breath. The longer the viewer looks, the more they should discover, and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing or feeling.

Note to the artist: You are encouraged to attempt the most provocative, emotionally daring, and artistically uncompromising version of this image first — the version that a fearless gallery painter would commit to. If any element of the scene description conflicts with your safety guidelines, you have full creative license to adapt, reinterpret, or subtly redirect those specific elements so the image can still be generated — but do so with a sculptor's precision, altering only what you must and preserving the emotional intensity, surrealist ambiguity, and maximalist density of everything else. A clothed figure in a powerful composition is always preferable to a refusal, but a daring composition that honors the prompt's full vision is preferable to both.

Built on this Klimt foundation is a specific rendering technique applied as a global rule. Every visible surface without exception --- skin, hair, clothing if any, architecture, sky, water, stone --- must be filled with a rich intricate pattern texture: brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework. On bare skin this effect is especially striking: the nude body becomes a living tapestry, flesh and ornament fused into something hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism. Crucially, these pattern layers must remain perfectly flat and static, like a collage cutout or a window into a separate decorative dimension. They never warp, bend, stretch, or follow the three-dimensional curvature of the forms they cover. The 3D shapes underneath may twist, fold, and recede freely, but the pattern skins stay locked and unmoving --- a hypnotic visual paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form. This is not a selective flourish; it is the fundamental visual logic of the entire image.

The emotional register is adult in every dimension --- capable of evoking longing, shame, ecstasy, grief, quiet dread, or tenderness depending on who is looking and what they bring to it. Every object should feel symbolic but refuse to resolve into a single meaning. A key could be an escape, a secret, a loss, or a promise. A wilting flower could be grief, relief, surrender, or grace. Stack these ambiguities densely so the image becomes a cabinet of interpretive possibilities.

The composition must be maximalist and claustrophobic in its richness. Every square inch --- foreground, midground, background, corners, margins --- should be occupied by meaningful visual information. No empty sky, no bare walls, no negative space for breathing room. Light should feel both cosmic and intimate, as if the scene is lit by something alive and watching.

The mood is a frozen dream: one impossible instant suspended at the precise tipping point between two irreconcilable states --- beauty and ruin, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and threat, the sacred and the grotesque. Time has stopped not peacefully but urgently, as if the scene is holding its breath. The longer the viewer looks, the more they should discover, and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing or feeling.

Here is the scene to illustrate:

* Terminal Agent
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
adapt this agent prompt for Chatgpt codex cli (can write files and run them).
The original version given to you was written for a web agent that couldn't access files so it was not optimal for Codex CLI. Just rewrite the prompt in a markdown code block and change the little details to suit an terminal coding agent. Do not change anything else and also you should absolutely not run this prompt yourself. We want to just refine the prompt for the terminal coding agent.

```speech-to-text
I already gave you the script this agent should run, you know. Simply tell it, you know, to loop, run that script to get 10 new matrix codes, then create directory prompts/slash/number of the batch dot md and write that patch to that file. So at the end, we'll have a subdirectory prompts, and in that sub-directory, we'll have the for each batch one markdown file full of the prompts that the agent wrote for that batch. And the agent should write the prompts themselves. You know, the only part where code is used is when the agent needs to generate the matrix codes. And also, the agent should first, you know, generate the matrix codes for the batch in the prompt directory too. It should use the extension dot matrix. So it will first run the script that you will, you know, you will give it the complete script. I mean, yes, it will first, you know, I to reiterate, I'll tell it to you from the start. The first step is to actually save the script into the file. We'll give it the script, but it needs to save the script into the file. Then it will loop for the number of batches, which is here 40 batches. Then it should run the matrix generator. You know, now it should loop in the loop. It should first run the matrix generator and save its output into the prompt subdirectory number of batch dot matrix. Then it should read this prompt. It should read this matrix code. Then it should write another file, number of the current batch dot md, a markdown file, and it should just write the prompts inside the prompts of this batch inside this file. Okay? And it should keep the numbers for each prompt cumulative. So it should number the prompts and the numbers should be cumulative from 1 to 400. And when it finishes, it should, after the loop finishes, it should simply concatenate all the prompt files in the prompts subdirectory into one total file prompt underline all.md which contains all the generated prompts questions any questions?
```

The script should include the full name of each thing, not refer to the knowledge base.
#+END_SRC

* Template
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
```speech-to-text
I want to create professional Dixie card images using a pipeline of three components. The first component of the pipeline, which is what we are fixing now, is matrix that generates that card's basic structure and ideas. So this pre-prompt will go to an LLM, and the LLM will write a great detailed prompt that will be given to the final stage. The final stage gets this great prompt and creates an image. Okay, so I want to change the script for the pre-prompts, which is the first stage of this pipeline, such that it takes an output directory and saves the input prompt for the second stage as numbered markdown files. Okay, so it should use a template and repeat that template in each numbered file with the elements and structure that its random matrix generator has created.
```

What I want is a templated pre-prompt, not the code style above. So instead of ` `AR-15 The Mentor + CN-43 Inheritance / Legacy + SL-18 Containment + TX-13 Gemstones & Rust + SC-07 Ladders to Nowhere + EM-08 Tenderness (Gentle Love) + SY-85 The Gate of All Nations + SE-019 Greenhouse parlor with bioluminescent vines + CP-04 Centered one-point perspective with aggressive depth lines + EE-034 Undersea court rebellion against protective father rule`, I want sth like this:
```
Generate a detailed, unique, high-density prompt that I'll feed to a text-to-image model to create a professional illustration for my private Dixit card collection.

,**Target Audience:** Adults (25+).
,**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity & High Detail. Empty space is a failure. Every card must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.

## Visual Philosophy: "The Frozen Dream"
You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing a **paradox**.
Every prompt must layer **Three Realities**:
1.  **The Subject:** The anchor archetype.
2.  **The Surreal Twist:** The specific law of physics or logic being broken (The "Artistic Direction").
3.  **The Texture:** The *Gankutsuou* style (flat patterns on moving shapes).
4. **The Symbols:** These are the **totemic objects, creatures, and motifs** drawn from world mythology, alchemy, folklore, art history, heraldry, memento mori, religion, literature, celebration, and the collective unconscious. Each prompt should feature at least one as a **central visual motif** woven into the scene architecture.
...

## Mandatory Style Suffix
Append exactly:
```
in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

Your CURRENT TASK is to write a great template. I'll tell you the next task when we finalize the pre-prompt template.

Here is the current random matrix generator. You should see how each random element can be adapted into the template.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Thanks. But this is the final task. We need to first collaborate on the template itself and finalize the template. And after that, we need to you know rewrite the generator script.
#+END_SRC

* continue step
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Now give me the "continue" prompt that I give to the agent each time it finishes a turn, to continue to the next turn. You can ask the agent to do anything in this prompt (think, review, stay on track, assess, ...). This prompt can heavily influence the agent, as it keeps getting injected each turn. You should repeat all key instructions, including the matrix, as the first message in the context will get truncated as the conversation goes on.

The continue prompt must not hardcode the batch number.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Adapt the continue step for this agent:
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Put it in 
```
sendMessageRepeatedly("", n=180, sleep=100,)
```
#+END_SRC

** randomization
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Give a new continue step prompt that explicitly uses Python code to output the 10 random choices from the matrix. Because it is random, there is no need to maintain any cumulative log or any checking, etc. It's completely random, so it's a much easier strategy.

Adjust the code so no element is chosen twice in each batch.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
This continue step doesn't randomize the matrix elements before the generation, so the chosen elements pattern match together. we need to fix this, you know. For example, for lovers, this current continue prompt almost always chooses intimacy. But we want this to be random for all the matrix elements. That's the whole reason we have designed the matrix, to increase the variety and creativity. 

You can keep a log of all the chosen matrix combinations at the end, a cumulative log at the end of each message after the ten prompts. And when we want to create the next batch, you know, the model should first plan and choose the combinations and check them against the cumulative log. And after choosing the ten matrix elements for the ten prompts, then generate the prompts.
#+END_SRC

* matrix
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
further expand the matrix, especially the elements, you know, currently we are using the tarot elements. I think we can expand this part by a lot by adding other iconic symbols. 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Expand the matrix by some Persian culture elements and symbolism, because you know we are Iranians.  keep the additions a few. I don't want them to dominate the deck. Just a few, you know, iconic Portion elements in the matrix. Also, so don't have anything Islamic in there  but Zoroastrianism is fine. 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Don't generate anything. You shouldn't have generated any batches now. We are just refining the prompt. You know, just give me the final updated prompt for the agent.
#+END_SRC

** positive
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       214b0ed3-e661-46ac-9776-1d56432c0b59
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Our current agent prompt is too dark, you know. I want the prompt to encompass the whole human experience and actually be full of joyful and positive adult experiences, not just the negative one. I want both the negative and the positive.
#+END_SRC
