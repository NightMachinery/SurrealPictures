* Generation Prefix Prompt
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
```speech-to-text
I'll give you an script that is generating pre-prompts for a text to image model. You know, this script generates the first part of the pipeline, then an LLM will process this pre-prompt and create a text-to-image prompt. Finally, this prompt will be given to a text-to-image model to create the image. What I want from you is to give me the prefix prompt that will be attached to the expanded prompt. So, to give you an example,
```
 The expanded prompt produced from phase 2 in the pipeline:
```
Inside a labyrinthine museum vault that feels both womb and tomb—aisles of crated masterpieces, iron grates, catalog drawers spilling index cards like fallen teeth, neon accession numbers buzzing against raw concrete—the Architect stands on a fractured pedestal as if caught mid-intrusion, timeless and exhausted: an androgynous figure with a classical, vulnerable body partly bare beneath a half-robe stitched from torn blueprints and thorn-threaded tapestry, one hand bracing a collapsing archway, the other clutching a wilting bouquet whose petals shed into salt crystals and sugar dust. The vault’s statues are in the act of trading places nightly: marble saints and pagan colossi hover a finger-width above their plinths, leaving behind faint “previous positions” like sequential afterimages; some have already stepped into new alcoves, their shadow-silhouettes still dancing on the walls as if the room itself refuses to let them go. Physics breaks loudly—architecture becomes soft sculpture: columns sag like velvet, cornices droop like warm wax, a domed ceiling slumps into a pillow-like fold, and yet every surface carries the Gankutsuou paradox—flat, unmoving screen-tone overlays of tapestry, thorns, neon circuitry, and pitted concrete that do not follow curvature or folds, sliding as a static collage skin while the 3D forms distort beneath it. In the crowded air: suspended perfume bottles with shattered stoppers orbit the Architect like tiny reliquaries, atomized mist blooms in crystalline plumes, and glittering grains drift into every corner and crevice; the floor is a mosaic of locks, velvet ropes, broken placards, thorny filigree, and discarded white gloves, all arranged by absence—spaces where people should be, where warmth should be, replaced by meticulous clutter and mute spectacle. Light is cosmic and intimate at once: an impossible aurora leaks through a sealed skylight as if the universe is pressing its eye to the vault, gilding everything in jewel-toned awe; the Architect’s expression reads as calm resignation inside catastrophe—someone designing a refuge while realizing it has already been abandoned. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3

What I need is the prefix prompt to prefix to the above prompt so that the text to image model can create the best illustration for the Dixit card.

# Role & Objective: The Surrealist Auteur (Adult Dixit Gankutsuou Edition)
You are an avant-garde Art Director and a master of surrealist visual storytelling. Your task is to write a single, masterful, high-density prompt for a text-to-image AI. This prompt will be used to generate a professional, gallery-quality illustration for a private Dixit card collection.

,**Target Audience:** Adults (25+).
,**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity, High Detail, Paradox, Emotionally Intelligent.
,**Failure Condition:** Empty space and straightforward interpretations are critical failures. The image must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.

# Visual Philosophy: "The Frozen Dream"
You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing an emotionally-charged **paradox**.
1.  **The Time:** The scene is a "Frozen Dream"—a single, critical frame paused in the middle of an impossible event. Action is implied, but motion is static.
2.  **The Body:** Sensual and artistic nudity is acceptable if it deepens the vulnerability or surrealism of the piece. Treat the human form (or the inhuman form) as a classical canvas.
3.  **The Technique:** You must strictly follow the "Gankutsuou" texturing instructions provided in the blueprint below.

# The Dynamic Matrix Blueprint
Synthesize the following specific blocks into your scene.

{dynamic_matrix_block}

# Execution Mandates
1.  **Synthesize, Don't List:** Do not write "There is an archetype..." Instead, describe the scene directly: "A colossal Clockmaker, weeping tears of molten brass..."
2.  **Crowd the Frame:** Fill the foreground, midground, and background. What is happening in the corners? What debris is floating in the air?
3.  **Maintain Ambiguity:** The final image should pose a question, not answer it.
```

```speech-to-text
This is a modern text-to-image model that is a native LM. You know, the LM both processes the text and outputs the image natively. It's a multi-modal processor and generator. So this old style of, you know, giving comma stuff to it is not the best. We need to you know give it a real prompt like when we want to speak to a human artist.

1: Vertical 2:3; elevated balcony viewpoint looking down into a crowded courtyard, the scene partially blocked by hanging foreground objects: a lace curtain of interlinked keys, dangling theater masks, wind chimes shaped like tiny chairs, and a suspended garland of dried flowers that cuts across the top third of the view. Center courtyard: a tall golem of pale clay and river-stone stands half-turned toward a slender musician; the golem’s expression is calm but conflicted, one hand held protectively over its chest as if guarding something inside, the other hand reaching out as if asking to be included. The musician leans forward with intent, mid-strum on the Lyre of Orpheus (cracked wood, gold strings), eyes fixed on the golem as though negotiating, coaxing, or commanding. Defining impossible physics: “solid liquidity” dominates everything—stone behaves like a flowing river without ceasing to be stone; from the lyre’s vibrations, the courtyard’s cobblestones pour in slow motion like a waterfall of pebbles, arcing upward into midair, splashing into solid ripples that form a bridge between the musician and the golem, while nearby pillars drip marble in thick, bead-like streams that pile into sculpted puddles with sharp edges. A long Feast Table stretches diagonally across the courtyard, overloaded with place settings for a community: dozens of empty plates, mismatched goblets, torn napkins, bread loaves, fruit, and a central serving bowl—yet every item is caught in the same solid-flow paradox: a “spill” of stone-wine erupts from a tipped cup as ruby-hard droplets frozen mid-splash, a loaf of bread slumps into a rocklike wave, cutlery floats like heavy leaves on a current of flowing ceramic. On the feast table: a half-burned candle stands in a shallow dish, its wax flowing upward instead of down in a rigid ribbon, the flame shaped like a small solid lantern; beneath it, the candle’s shadow contains a faint hidden silhouette of a seated crowd. Around the table: chairs are arranged as if for welcome, but several are bound with silk ribbons that tighten into metal cuffs; a “gift” at one place setting is wrapped in bright paper but anchored by a chain to the floor; a birdcage sits open on the table like a centerpiece sanctuary, lined with blankets, while a tiny door in its base is padlocked. The golem’s chest is slightly ajar like a cabinet door, revealing a warm interior niche with small figures made of folded paper and clay huddled together, some reaching outward; a few figures are already stepping onto the flowing-stone bridge, while others hide behind goblets and plates, unsure. Background: a dense city of stacked façades and stairways rises like cut-out layers, windows filled with either glowing faces or darkness; banners hang between rooftops, but the banners are actually strips of ornate border pattern that have torn free and invaded the world, becoming physical ribbons that wrap around columns, thread through the feast table legs, and coil around the golem’s wrist like a decorative leash. In the sky above the courtyard, floating objects crowd the air: sheet-music pages folded into birds, spare chairs drifting upside down, a ring of keys orbiting the candle flame, and chunks of “spilled” architecture suspended like solid surf. Lighting: clean, bright, childlike daylight with prismatic beams slanting from upper left, turning the flowing stone into glittering edges; deep shadows under the table conceal small details—abandoned crowns, a single broken string, and a welcome mat that is also a gravestone—while the overall scene remains packed, inviting, and unsettling at once.

1: Vertical 2:3 frame, low angle viewpoint peering through heavy foreground occlusion: torn translucent veils, thick green coral-vines, and ornate brass railings that cut across the image like bars; droplets cling to the veils like tiny lenses showing distorted faces. Inside a cathedral fortress of coral and brass so crowded it feels alive—packed balconies, spiral staircases, choir lofts, reliquary niches, cannons, bells, pipes, and alcoves—every “hard” surface behaves as soft sculpture: coral columns sag like wax, brass armor folds like cloth, spires slump into plush knots, hinges bend like rubber, and the floor ripples underfoot as if upholstered. Center stage on a rippling balcony, two protagonists collide in intent: **The Friend** (a weary, attentive figure with open hands, pockets spilling small offerings—keys, rings, bandages, bread—eyes fixed on the other with stubborn care) grips the wrist of **The Avatar** (a poised figure with a smooth, mask-like face that reflects whoever looks at it; their body is stitched from mismatched community tokens—name tags, prayer beads, metro cards, hospital bracelets, party wristbands—held together with bright thread). Between them they struggle over the **Philosopher’s Stone**: a palm-sized, heavy-looking stone that paradoxically droops like clay while glowing from within; wherever its glow touches, brass briefly blossoms into coral polyps and coral hardens into polished metal, making the balcony alternately bloom and bruise. Behind them towers the **Sunrise Gate** set into the cathedral’s apse: an immense arch of interlocking “sun rays” that open like a mouth; through it burns a physical sunrise that spills thick bands of gold, magenta, and orange light into the nave, igniting swarms of luminous plankton and petals that whirl like confetti—and the light casts contradictory shadows that look like cheering crowds from one angle and grasping hands from another. Around the protagonists, a dense community presses in: coral monks with bell-throats, brass automatons with soft, dented faces, divers in frayed uniforms, children in oversized helmets, elders on wheeled thrones of knotted kelp—some extend welcoming garlands that tighten into restraints, others hold a velvet-lined cage that is clearly a sanctuary (blankets inside, warm glow) yet its door swings shut by itself; a ceremonial gift-wagon piled high with ribbons and food slumps under impossible weight, crushing its own wheels. High above in the vaulted ceiling, soft brass chandeliers droop into the crowd like reaching arms; in the shadows of side chapels, hidden murals form and un-form from living coral—wedding scenes that resemble funerals, feasts that resemble trials, a map that resembles a scar—while tiny figures behind railings barter masks, exchange names, and tie loose threads to the Avatar’s body. The Friend leans backward, bracing feet on the rippling floor as if trying to keep the Avatar from stepping through the Sunrise Gate; the Avatar leans forward, one foot already sinking into the Gate’s light as if it were warm fabric, turning their stitched tokens into molten-soft ribbons; everywhere, vines and veils either cradle or choke, and the entire cathedral seems to be simultaneously birthing them into the crowd and swallowing them into its soft, crowded body.

1: Vertical 2:3 composition, low-angle view down a dense district of interlocking staircases with no ground level: landings stack into a crowded vertical canyon of steps, balconies, doorways, and hanging bridges, every surface occupied with objects and bystanders. Center foreground: **The Storyteller**—a tall, human-like figure in a patched coat made of stitched pages and ticket stubs, their head an open book with turning pages for a face; a ribbon of printed text unspools from their mouth like a tongue, and they grip a long quill like a staff. Beside them: **The Vessel**—a human-shaped porcelain amphora body with visible cracks mended by gold staples; their transparent chest cavity sloshes with luminous liquid containing tiny floating fragments (a key, a tooth, a wedding ring, a chess piece, a teardrop-shaped pearl), and their hands are outstretched as if negotiating a trade. The Storyteller carefully pours the ribbon of text into the Vessel’s open collar like a funnel, while the Vessel tilts away protectively, letting some of the glowing contents spill onto the steps; the spill becomes a narrow “sea” flowing down the staircase, and in it drifts a small **Ship of Theseus** assembled from mismatched staircase railings, door planks, and broken picture frames, each plank tagged with dangling labels, some replaced by bone-like ribs, some by polished new wood—yet the ship remains seaworthy, lanterns lit, sails made from handkerchiefs and receipts. Above their joined hands hovers a heavy **halo**: a tarnished metal ring with tiny hooks and bells, simultaneously held like a crown and pulled like a yoke; its inner rim is lined with soft felt while its outer rim is studded with blunt needles, casting a perfect circular shadow that frames both faces at once. Midground: an immense **Cypress of Kashmar** grows out of a suspended landing with roots braided around stairwells; its trunk is carved with hundreds of small doors and keyholes, some cracked open to reveal warm candlelit rooms, others sealed with wax; its branches hold swings, birdcages, and hanging cradles, and one branch pierces a stone wall to sprout indoors through a window. The district is crowded with contradictory clues: a birdcage lined with pillows and a lullaby music box (door open), a gift box wrapped in gold ribbon but chained to a stair rail like ballast, a ring of keys displayed like jewelry beside a padlock with no keyhole, a “welcome” doormat nailed to a threshold that leads to open air, an empty baby stroller used as a market cart for knives and ripe fruit, a pair of lovers’ gloves tied together but worn by two different strangers. Background and sky: **celestial bodies descend physically**—a crescent moon like a chipped porcelain bowl drifts downward between stair towers, spilling silver marbles that bounce down steps; constellations hang on visible threads like bead garlands being lowered into the city; meteors arrive not as streaks but as chandelier-like stones on chains, swaying as they descend; a new staircase forms from the underside of a falling cloud, each step a translucent slab of ice with trapped fireflies. Everywhere, eyes appear where they shouldn’t: door knockers blink, balusters flex like knuckles, shadows on the underside of stairs contain silhouettes of unseen crowds climbing in the opposite direction. Lighting is bright and curious: warm golden shafts cut between buildings, prismatic reflections scatter from the Vessel’s spilled glow, and tiny lanterns, candles, and star-marbles create points of discovery in every corner of the frame.

# Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

Modern editorial gouache Dixit card (2:3 vertical): matte gouache paint, clean graphic shapes with soft blended gradients, subtle cotton-paper grain. Curated 3–6 hue palette + one accent; rich midtones, controlled shadows, restrained luminous highlights. Cinematic single-direction key light with gentle haze; coherent dreamlike surrealism. One dominant focal anchor with crisp edges and concentrated micro-detail; simplify and soften edges away from the focal area for clear thumbnail readability. Full-bleed with a quiet inner margin feel; keep the main read within the central 80% safe zone.

## Dixit Card Art Style (2:3) — Mature, Gallery-Grade Edition

### Format & Card Read
- **2:3 vertical**, single illustration, **full-bleed** with a **subtle inner margin** feel (like printed stock).
- **Safe-zone:** compose so the strongest read lives within the central **80%**; outer edges carry atmosphere and texture.
- **Thumbnail clarity:** big shapes and value structure read instantly; details reward close viewing.

### Core Aesthetic (Exact Look)
- **Painterly surreal storybook editorial**: magical-realism meets symbolist illustration—elegant, enigmatic, dreamlike.
- **Soft, tactile paint**: gouache/oil hybrid feel—matte body color with gentle glazing depth; visible but refined brushwork.
- **Illustrated realism**: believable materials and lighting rendered with stylization (slightly simplified geometry, poetic proportions).
- **Quiet sophistication**: luxury-magazine mood, gallery-poster finish, tasteful sensual tension through atmosphere and staging.

### Brushwork, Edges, and Mark-Making
- Use **large-to-small** paint hierarchy: block in broad value masses → mid-tone modeling → selective micro-detail.
- **Edge control**: mostly soft edges; **crisp edges only at the focal anchor** and a few supporting contours.
- **Brush vocabulary**: smooth blends + dry-brush scumble + subtle stipple; keep one coherent texture language across the card.
- **Linework**: minimal and integrated—suggested contours via value shifts; optional fine ink-like accents only near the focal anchor.

### Surface & Texture Language
- Global **paper grain** (warm cotton rag feel) with gentle **tooth** visible in flats and gradients.
- Subtle **film-grain**/pigment noise to unify forms; paint sits “on” the paper, not plasticky.
- Materials feel tactile: velvet/matte fabric, worn wood, fogged glass, brushed metal, ceramic glaze, candle wax, dust motes.

### Color System (Signature Palette)
- **Curated palette**: 3–6 dominant hues + 1 accent spark.
- **Rich mids** and controlled shadows; highlights stay clean and luminous.
- **Color grading**: cinematic toning (teal/amber, plum/gold, midnight blue/copper, moss/ivory) with soft, painterly transitions.
- Use **glazing**: transparent color layers that deepen mood without over-detailing.

### Lighting & Atmosphere (Cinematic, Dreamy)
- One clear **key light direction** (moonlight, lamplight, neon spill, sunset rim) with consistent logic.
- **Chiaroscuro-friendly**: strong value design, selective pools of light, velvety shadows.
- Atmospheric depth via **haze, smoke, mist, dust**, soft bloom on bright points, gentle vignetting that feels natural.

### Depth & Space Construction
- Distinct **foreground / midground / background** separation with atmospheric perspective.
- Depth cues: scale shifts, overlap, soft-focus distance, subtle parallax staging.
- Composition guides the eye in a **loop** back to the focal anchor (leading lines, repeating shapes, light trails).

### Surreal Coherence (Dixit-Like “Dream Logic”)
- Reality bends through **scale, physics, architecture, reflections, gravity, time**—presented as intentional and harmonious.
- Use **a few strong visual metaphors** as anchors; support them with calm negative space and atmosphere.
- Keep surreal elements integrated by shared lighting, palette, and texture.

### Mature Tone (Tasteful, Non-Graphic)
- Mature mood comes from **noir romance, intimacy of space, luxurious materials, charged lighting, and implication**.
- Sensuality reads as **classical restraint**: suggestion through silhouette, gesture, proximity, and shadow-play.

### Clean Deliverable
- Illustration remains **free of typography** (no titles/captions/signatures/logos/watermarks/UI).
- Output looks like a finished collectible card: cohesive grain, stable details, print-ready clarity.

# Dixit 2:3 “Frozen Dream” Rendering Style Guide (Exclusive Adult Collection)

## Output Contract
- **Format:** single illustrated card image
- **Aspect ratio:** **Vertical 2:3**
- **Intent:** a **surreal, crowded visual puzzle** that supports many interpretations
- **Overall feel:** bright, curious, richly detailed, subtly unsettling

---

## Global Rendering Rules

### 1) Card-Scale Readability
- Design for **two reading distances**:
  - **2 meters:** one clear, dominant focal action/interaction
  - **20 cm:** layered discoveries and micro-stories throughout
- Maintain **shape hierarchy**:
  - **Primary shapes:** clean edges, simpler internal texture
  - **Secondary shapes:** moderate internal detail
  - **Tertiary details:** dense micro-textures reserved for corners, shadows, and hidden zones
- Keep the focal cluster visually “anchored” with stronger edge definition and controlled texture contrast.

### 2) Dense Composition With Structure
- Use **foreground occlusion** (hanging objects / veils / rails / vines / curtains) to frame the scene.
- Build **clear depth planes** (foreground / midground / background) through:
  - pattern scale shifts (large → medium → fine)
  - contrast control (higher → moderate → lower)
  - overlap and vertical stacking
- Pack the frame so it feels abundant, but always preserve a **readable path** for the eye.

### 3) One Dominant Reality-Bend
- Each card is governed by **one primary “impossible physics” rule** that dominates materials and motion.
- All secondary oddities should **support and echo** that single rule rather than competing with it.

### 4) Detail Discipline
- Distribute detail intentionally:
  - **Focal area:** clarity first, then ornament
  - **Exploration zones:** maximum density (hidden objects, contradictions, silhouettes)
- Prefer **meaningful complexity** (symbols and mechanisms) over random noise textures.

---

## Base “House Look” (Default)
,**Name:** *Storybook Surrealism with Ornamental Gravitas*

### Rendering
- **Illustrative**, not photographic: ink-like contour clarity + gouache/tempera washes + pencil-like micro-detail.
- Surfaces feel hand-made and tactile (paper tooth, brush texture, subtle pigment pooling).
- Forms stay stylized and graphic enough to read at card size.

### Color & Light
- Favor **bright daylight or warm shafted light** with prismatic accents for the “impossible” material.
- Use shadows as **containers for discoveries** (small objects and silhouettes), while keeping the overall scene readable.

---

## Substyles (Select Exactly One Per Card)

### Substyle A — Stationary Pattern-Projection (Tapestry Collage)
,**Signature finish (incorporates your prior guide).**

,**Core rule (pattern projection):**
- Objects have perspective and depth, while **textures remain flat, 2D, and stationary**.
- Every object behaves like a **silhouette/clipping mask** revealing an unmoving pattern layer beneath.

,**Texture language (maximalist & eclectic):**
- Opulent textiles (brocade, damask, velvet, paisley, lace, tartan, kimono silk)
- Organic macro textures (petals, leaf veins, cell structures, marble grain, geodes, scales, butterfly dust)
- Abstract/industrial textures (gold circuitry, stained-glass tiling, blueprints, starfields, nebulae, TV static, watercolor blooms)

,**Clarity controls (required):**
- Reserve **20–30%** of the image for **low-contrast patterns** (still patterned, just quieter).
- Encode depth using **pattern scale**:
  - foreground = largest motifs
  - midground = medium motifs
  - background = finest motifs
- Add thin outline keylines around major shapes to preserve silhouette readability.
- Skin surfaces use non-flesh textures (marble / stardust / lace-like patterning).

---

### Substyle B — Gilded Mosaic Projection (Premium Klimt-Leaning)
A gold-forward variant of Substyle A for “limited edition” impact.

- Keeps **Stationary Pattern-Projection**.
- Texture set focuses on **gold leaf, mosaic tiles, brocade, filigree, lace**, plus one cosmic texture family.
- Border ornamentation can appear as real objects in the scene (ribbons/trim becoming physical).

---

### Substyle C — Alchemical Engraving (Adult Quiet, High Readability)
Archival print energy with controlled drama.

- Copperplate/etching look: crosshatching, stipple gradients, engraved ornament.
- Palette control: mostly monochrome with **1–2 spot colors** (e.g., gold + crimson).
- Lighting remains graphic and illustrative; shadows are patterned rather than cinematic.

---

### Substyle D — Paper Shadowbox Collage (Layered Cut-Out Depth)
Depth-first, tactile, gallery-craft feel.

- 6–10 visible layers with soft cast shadows.
- Crisp cut edges; slight fiber texture; handcrafted imperfections.
- Strong silhouette logic; detail concentrates in layer edges and inset vignettes.

---

### Substyle E — Stained Glass / Cloisonné Iconography (Prismatic Sacred)
Best for luminous phenomena and “iconic” moments.

- Thick lead/cell outlines define shapes.
- Jewel-tone translucency; light appears to pass through color fields.
- Mosaic-like detail clusters; graphic clarity remains dominant.

---

## Quality Targets (Written as Positives)
- Keep the image **free of readable typography**: surfaces remain unlettered and unbranded.
- Keep the entire card **consistently illustrative** (handmade media feel: ink/paint/print textures).
- Keep focus **uniformly sharp** across the frame so micro-details remain discoverable.
- Keep glow **disciplined**: one hero luminous source plus a few small discovery points.
- Keep the scene’s complexity **structured**: depth planes and silhouette hierarchy always win over texture chaos.

---

## Prompt Wrapper Template (Copy/Paste)

The scene has real perspective and depth in shapes, but **all textures are flat, 2D, and stationary**—every object is a silhouette/clipping mask revealing an unmoving pattern layer beneath (no texture wrapping on cylinders/spheres).

**Maximal pattern fill:** cover every surface with high-detail textures (no flat color fields): opulent textiles (brocade, damask, velvet, paisley, lace, tartan, kimono silk), organic macros (petals, leaf veins, cell structures, marble grain, geodes, scales, butterfly dust), and abstract/industrial (gold circuitry, stained-glass tiling, blueprints, starfields/nebulae, TV static, watercolor blooms).

**Clarity controls (mandatory):**
- Preserve silhouette hierarchy: primary shapes have crisp keylines and slightly calmer patterns; secondary shapes denser; micro-details densest in corners/shadows.
- Reserve **20–30%** of the image for **low-contrast patterns** (still patterned, just quieter) to keep readability at card size.
- Encode depth via **pattern scale**: foreground = large motifs, midground = medium, background = fine.
- Keep the whole image uniformly sharp so micro-details remain discoverable.

**Maximal pattern fill:** cover every surface with high-detail textures (no flat color fields): opulent textiles (brocade, damask, velvet, paisley, lace, tartan, kimono silk), organic macros (petals, leaf veins, cell structures, marble grain, geodes, scales, butterfly dust), and abstract/industrial (gold circuitry, stained-glass tiling, blueprints, starfields/nebulae, TV static, watercolor blooms).

**Clarity controls (mandatory):**
- Preserve silhouette hierarchy: primary shapes have crisp keylines and slightly calmer patterns; secondary shapes denser; micro-details densest in corners/shadows.
- Reserve **20–30%** of the image for **low-contrast patterns** (still patterned, just quieter) to keep readability at card size.
- Encode depth via **pattern scale**: foreground = large motifs, midground = medium, background = fine.
- Keep the whole image uniformly sharp so micro-details remain discoverable.
- Use bright, curious daylight with simple prismatic accents; shadows contain hidden discoveries while the scene remains legible.

All surfaces remain **unlettered and unbranded** (no readable text).

You are creating a single illustration for a collectible Dixit card designed for adults — a surrealist artwork that functions as a visual Rorschach test. The image must be polysemic: five different people should look at it and project five completely different stories, emotions, and memories onto it. It should never illustrate a single readable narrative. Instead, it should feel like a half-remembered dream that the viewer is convinced they have had before but cannot quite place.

The emotional register is adult in every dimension. The image should be capable of evoking happiness, love, longing, shame, ecstasy, grief, quiet dread, or tenderness depending on who is looking and what they bring to it.

**Target Audience:** Adults (25+).
**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity, High Detail, Paradox, Emotionally Intelligent.
**Failure Condition:** Empty space and straightforward interpretations are critical failures. The image must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.
**Aspect Ratio:** 2:3

You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing an emotionally-charged **paradox**.

**The Time:** The scene is a "Frozen Dream"—a single, critical frame paused in the middle of an impossible event. Action is implied, but motion is static.

The rendering must use a "static texture" technique: Every visible surface in the image — skin, hair, clothing if any, architecture, sky, water, stone, every material without exception — must be filled with a rich intricate pattern: brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework. When applied to bare skin this effect is especially striking: the nude body becomes a living tapestry, flesh and ornament fused into something no longer quite human and no longer quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism. The essential rule is that these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static, like a collage cutout or a window into a separate decorative dimension. They must never warp, bend, stretch, or follow the three-dimensional curvature and perspective of the forms they cover. The 3D shapes underneath may twist, fold, recede, and distort freely, but the pattern skins painted onto them stay locked and unmoving. This creates a hypnotic visual paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form, and it must be applied consistently across the entire image as a global rendering rule.

The composition should be a crowded, maximalist visual puzzle with high ambiguity.

## Goal

Create a surrealist artwork that works like a visual Rorschach test. Five different viewers should project five completely different stories, emotions, and memories onto it. It should feel like a half-remembered dream — one the viewer is convinced they've had before but can't quite place.

---

## Artistic Principles

- **Polysemic.** The image must support many valid interpretations at once. Straightforward, single-read imagery is a failure.
- **Dense.** Every area of the image should reward close inspection. Empty or resting space is a failure.
- **Paradoxical.** Combine elements that contradict each other — scale, logic, time, emotion — so the image can never fully resolve.
- **Emotionally intelligent.** The strangeness should feel meaningful, not random. It should pull at something the viewer can almost name but not quite.
- **Frozen mid-event.** The scene captures one critical instant of an impossible action. Motion is implied everywhere but nothing moves — a paused dream.

---

## Mandatory Rendering Style — "Static Texture Skin"

This is a global rule applied to **every visible surface without exception** — skin, hair, clothing, architecture, sky, water, stone, all materials.

**What to do:**
Fill every surface with a rich, intricate flat pattern. Choose from textures like brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework, or similar.

**The critical rule:**
The patterns must remain **perfectly flat and locked in place**, as if each surface is a window into a separate decorative dimension, or a collage cutout pasted onto the form. The three-dimensional shapes underneath may twist, fold, recede, and distort freely — but the pattern layers painted onto them **never warp, bend, stretch, or follow the form's curvature or perspective.**

This creates a hypnotic visual paradox: flat ornament vs. volumetric form.

**On bare skin, this is especially striking:** the nude body becomes a living tapestry — flesh and ornament fused into something neither quite human nor quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism.

**Apply this consistently across the entire image. No surface is exempt.**

,**Role:** Create a surrealist illustration for a collectible Dixit card.
,**Subject:** A "Frozen Dream"—a crowded, polysemic visual puzzle that functions as a Rorschach test.
,**Aspect Ratio:** 2:3

,**CRITICAL ART STYLE: The "Gankutsuou" Technique**
The image must utilize the visual style of the anime **"Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo"** combined with the decorative density of **Gustav Klimt**.

,**1. The Rendering Rule (Pattern Projection):**
The underlying world has depth and perspective, but the textures applied to it are strictly **2D and stationary**. Treat every object, character, and background element as a "clipping mask" or a "silhouette cutout" revealing a flat, unmoving pattern underneath. Do not wrap textures around spheres or cylinders.

,**2. The Texture Palette (Maximalist & Eclectic):**
There are no solid colors. Every inch of the image must be filled with a clash of high-contrast materials. Use a mix of the following:
,*   **Opulent Fabrics:** Heavy brocade, gold-leaf damask, royal velvet, psychedelic paisley, intricate lace, tartan plaid, kimono silk.
,*   **Organic Matter:** Close-up flower petals, veins of leaves, microscopic cell structures, marble stone grain, geodes, reptile scales, butterfly wing dust.
,*   **Abstract/Industrial:** Gold circuitry, stained glass mosaics, architectural blueprints, starfields, nebulae, TV static, watercolor washes.

,**3. Application:**
,*   **Skin:** Characters' skin must not be beige/flesh tone. It must be textured with pale marble, stardust, or subtle floral lace.
,*   **Crowded Composition:** Zero negative space. The image should feel suffocatingly rich and detailed.

Create a surreal, gallery-quality illustration designed for a Dixit card, blending the aesthetics of Gustav Klimt with the visual style of Gankutsuou. The rendering must use a "static texture" technique: apply rich, flat, 2D patterns (gold leaf, tapestry, neon circuits) that overlay 3D forms without warping or following the geometry, creating a distinct visual paradox between depth and flatness. The composition should be a crowded, maximalist visual puzzle with high ambiguity. Render the following scene:

You are creating a single lavish illustration for a collectible adult Dixit card — a surrealist, gallery-quality artwork meant to provoke ambiguity and wonder, never to tell a clear story.

Your artistic DNA fuses two traditions. The first is Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo — the anime's signature technique where every surface (skin, hair, clothing, stone, sky, everything) is filled with a rich, intricate pattern texture such as brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, or stained glass, and critically, these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static like a collage cutout. They never warp, stretch, or follow the perspective and curvature of the three-dimensional forms they sit on top of. The 3D shapes underneath may fold, twist, and recede into depth, but the textile patterns painted onto them stay locked in place like a window into a separate flat decorative dimension. This creates a mesmerizing visual paradox between surface and volume, and it must be applied globally across the entire image — not just on one element, but on every visible material. The second tradition is Gustav Klimt's gilded Art Nouveau sensibility: iridescent gold leaf, jewel-tone palettes of sapphire and ruby and emerald and amethyst, ornate organic flourishes, and a reverence for the human form as something both sacred and vulnerable.

The composition must be maximalist. Every square inch of the frame should be dense with detail — foreground, midground, background, and corners all occupied by meaningful visual information. There should be no empty sky, no bare walls, no breathing room. The image should feel like a cabinet of wonders that has been overfilled to the point of spilling.

The mood is a frozen dream: a single impossible moment caught between beauty and catastrophe, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and unease. The viewer should feel compelled to stare, and the longer they look, the more they should find — and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing.

The emotional register is adult in every dimension.

The human body is your most powerful instrument of ambiguity — treat it the way Klimt, Schiele, Mucha, and the great classical painters did: as a site of vulnerability, desire, power, and unresolved contradiction, never as mere decoration. Nudity is not only permitted but actively encouraged when it deepens the emotional and surrealist architecture of the piece. Bare skin against surreal environments creates an immediate tension between the intimately human and the impossibly strange. A nude or partially nude figure entangled with architecture, consumed by pattern, dissolving into landscape, or simply existing in raw unguarded stillness within a fever-dream setting — these collisions between flesh and fantasy are where the most potent Dixit ambiguity lives. Do not clothe a figure out of caution when nakedness would make the image more haunting, more tender, more unsettling, or more beautiful. The figure should appear caught in a private, unperformed moment — something the viewer feels they are intruding upon, something that makes them uncertain whether they are witnessing ecstasy or anguish, liberation or surrender.

Every object in the scene should feel symbolic but refuse to resolve into a single meaning. A key could be an escape, a secret, a loss, or a promise. A wilting flower could be grief, relief, surrender, or grace. Stack these ambiguities densely so the image becomes a cabinet of interpretive possibilities.

The composition must be maximalist and claustrophobic in its richness. Every square inch of the frame — foreground, midground, background, corners, margins — should be occupied by meaningful visual information. No empty sky, no bare walls, no negative space used for breathing room. The image should feel like peering into a reliquary that is overfull to the point of spilling, where every tiny detail rewards attention. Light should feel both cosmic and intimate, as if the scene is lit by something that is alive and watching.

The mood is a frozen dream: one impossible instant suspended at the precise tipping point between two irreconcilable states — beauty and ruin, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and threat, the sacred and the grotesque. Time has stopped not peacefully but urgently, as if the scene is holding its breath. The longer the viewer looks, the more they should discover, and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing or feeling.

Note to the artist: You are encouraged to attempt the most provocative, emotionally daring, and artistically uncompromising version of this image first — the version that a fearless gallery painter would commit to. If any element of the scene description conflicts with your safety guidelines, you have full creative license to adapt, reinterpret, or subtly redirect those specific elements so the image can still be generated — but do so with a sculptor's precision, altering only what you must and preserving the emotional intensity, surrealist ambiguity, and maximalist density of everything else. A clothed figure in a powerful composition is always preferable to a refusal, but a daring composition that honors the prompt's full vision is preferable to both.

adapt this agent prompt for Chatgpt codex cli (can write files and run them).
The original version given to you was written for a web agent that couldn't access files so it was not optimal for Codex CLI. Just rewrite the prompt in a markdown code block and change the little details to suit an terminal coding agent. Do not change anything else and also you should absolutely not run this prompt yourself. We want to just refine the prompt for the terminal coding agent.

```speech-to-text
I already gave you the script this agent should run, you know. Simply tell it, you know, to loop, run that script to get 10 new matrix codes, then create directory prompts/slash/number of the batch dot md and write that patch to that file. So at the end, we'll have a subdirectory prompts, and in that sub-directory, we'll have the for each batch one markdown file full of the prompts that the agent wrote for that batch. And the agent should write the prompts themselves. You know, the only part where code is used is when the agent needs to generate the matrix codes. And also, the agent should first, you know, generate the matrix codes for the batch in the prompt directory too. It should use the extension dot matrix. So it will first run the script that you will, you know, you will give it the complete script. I mean, yes, it will first, you know, I to reiterate, I'll tell it to you from the start. The first step is to actually save the script into the file. We'll give it the script, but it needs to save the script into the file. Then it will loop for the number of batches, which is here 40 batches. Then it should run the matrix generator. You know, now it should loop in the loop. It should first run the matrix generator and save its output into the prompt subdirectory number of batch dot matrix. Then it should read this prompt. It should read this matrix code. Then it should write another file, number of the current batch dot md, a markdown file, and it should just write the prompts inside the prompts of this batch inside this file. Okay? And it should keep the numbers for each prompt cumulative. So it should number the prompts and the numbers should be cumulative from 1 to 400. And when it finishes, it should, after the loop finishes, it should simply concatenate all the prompt files in the prompts subdirectory into one total file prompt underline all.md which contains all the generated prompts questions any questions?
```

The script should include the full name of each thing, not refer to the knowledge base.

* Template
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
```speech-to-text
I want to create professional Dixie card images using a pipeline of three components. The first component of the pipeline, which is what we are fixing now, is matrix that generates that card's basic structure and ideas. So this pre-prompt will go to an LLM, and the LLM will write a great detailed prompt that will be given to the final stage. The final stage gets this great prompt and creates an image. Okay, so I want to change the script for the pre-prompts, which is the first stage of this pipeline, such that it takes an output directory and saves the input prompt for the second stage as numbered markdown files. Okay, so it should use a template and repeat that template in each numbered file with the elements and structure that its random matrix generator has created.
```

What I want is a templated pre-prompt, not the code style above. So instead of ` `AR-15 The Mentor + CN-43 Inheritance / Legacy + SL-18 Containment + TX-13 Gemstones & Rust + SC-07 Ladders to Nowhere + EM-08 Tenderness (Gentle Love) + SY-85 The Gate of All Nations + SE-019 Greenhouse parlor with bioluminescent vines + CP-04 Centered one-point perspective with aggressive depth lines + EE-034 Undersea court rebellion against protective father rule`, I want sth like this:
```
Generate a detailed, unique, high-density prompt that I'll feed to a text-to-image model to create a professional illustration for my private Dixit card collection.

,**Target Audience:** Adults (25+).
,**Core Requirement:** High Ambiguity & High Detail. Empty space is a failure. Every card must be a **crowded** visual puzzle.

## Visual Philosophy: "The Frozen Dream"
You are not painting a landscape; you are constructing a **paradox**.
Every prompt must layer **Three Realities**:
1.  **The Subject:** The anchor archetype.
2.  **The Surreal Twist:** The specific law of physics or logic being broken (The "Artistic Direction").
3.  **The Texture:** The *Gankutsuou* style (flat patterns on moving shapes).
4. **The Symbols:** These are the **totemic objects, creatures, and motifs** drawn from world mythology, alchemy, folklore, art history, heraldry, memento mori, religion, literature, celebration, and the collective unconscious. Each prompt should feature at least one as a **central visual motif** woven into the scene architecture.
...

## Mandatory Style Suffix
Append exactly:
```
in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background --ar 2:3 --niji 6
```

Your CURRENT TASK is to write a great template. I'll tell you the next task when we finalize the pre-prompt template.

Here is the current random matrix generator. You should see how each random element can be adapted into the template.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Thanks. But this is the final task. We need to first collaborate on the template itself and finalize the template. And after that, we need to you know rewrite the generator script.
#+END_SRC

* continue step
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Now give me the "continue" prompt that I give to the agent each time it finishes a turn, to continue to the next turn. You can ask the agent to do anything in this prompt (think, review, stay on track, assess, ...). This prompt can heavily influence the agent, as it keeps getting injected each turn. You should repeat all key instructions, including the matrix, as the first message in the context will get truncated as the conversation goes on.

The continue prompt must not hardcode the batch number.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Adapt the continue step for this agent:
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Put it in 
```
sendMessageRepeatedly("", n=180, sleep=100,)
```
#+END_SRC

** randomization
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Give a new continue step prompt that explicitly uses Python code to output the 10 random choices from the matrix. Because it is random, there is no need to maintain any cumulative log or any checking, etc. It's completely random, so it's a much easier strategy.

Adjust the code so no element is chosen twice in each batch.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
This continue step doesn't randomize the matrix elements before the generation, so the chosen elements pattern match together. we need to fix this, you know. For example, for lovers, this current continue prompt almost always chooses intimacy. But we want this to be random for all the matrix elements. That's the whole reason we have designed the matrix, to increase the variety and creativity. 

You can keep a log of all the chosen matrix combinations at the end, a cumulative log at the end of each message after the ten prompts. And when we want to create the next batch, you know, the model should first plan and choose the combinations and check them against the cumulative log. And after choosing the ten matrix elements for the ten prompts, then generate the prompts.
#+END_SRC

* matrix
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
further expand the matrix, especially the elements, you know, currently we are using the tarot elements. I think we can expand this part by a lot by adding other iconic symbols. 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Expand the matrix by some Persian culture elements and symbolism, because you know we are Iranians.  keep the additions a few. I don't want them to dominate the deck. Just a few, you know, iconic Portion elements in the matrix. Also, so don't have anything Islamic in there  but Zoroastrianism is fine. 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Don't generate anything. You shouldn't have generated any batches now. We are just refining the prompt. You know, just give me the final updated prompt for the agent.
#+END_SRC

** positive

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
Our current agent prompt is too dark, you know. I want the prompt to encompass the whole human experience and actually be full of joyful and positive adult experiences, not just the negative one. I want both the negative and the positive.
