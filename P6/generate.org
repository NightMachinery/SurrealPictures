msg_opus_1 = "You are creating a single lavish illustration for a collectible adult Dixit card — a surrealist, gallery-quality artwork meant to provoke ambiguity and wonder, never to tell a clear story.\n\nYour artistic DNA fuses two traditions. The first is Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo — the anime's signature technique where every surface (skin, hair, clothing, stone, sky, everything) is filled with a rich, intricate pattern texture such as brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, or stained glass, and critically, these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static like a collage cutout. They never warp, stretch, or follow the perspective and curvature of the three-dimensional forms they sit on top of. The 3D shapes underneath may fold, twist, and recede into depth, but the textile patterns painted onto them stay locked in place like a window into a separate flat decorative dimension. This creates a mesmerizing visual paradox between surface and volume, and it must be applied globally across the entire image — not just on one element, but on every visible material. The second tradition is Gustav Klimt's gilded Art Nouveau sensibility: iridescent gold leaf, jewel-tone palettes of sapphire and ruby and emerald and amethyst, ornate organic flourishes, and a reverence for the human form as something both sacred and vulnerable.\n\nThe composition must be maximalist. Every square inch of the frame should be dense with detail — foreground, midground, background, and corners all occupied by meaningful visual information. There should be no empty sky, no bare walls, no breathing room. The image should feel like a cabinet of wonders that has been overfilled to the point of spilling.\n\nThe mood is a frozen dream: a single impossible moment caught between beauty and catastrophe, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and unease. The viewer should feel compelled to stare, and the longer they look, the more they should find — and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing.\n\nHere is the scene to illustrate:"

msg_opus_1_1_m = "You are creating a single illustration for a collectible Dixit card designed for adults — a surrealist artwork that functions as a visual Rorschach test. The image must be polysemic: five different people should look at it and project five completely different stories, emotions, and memories onto it. It should never illustrate a single readable narrative. Instead, it should feel like a half-remembered dream that the viewer is convinced they have had before but cannot quite place.\n\nThe emotional register is adult in every dimension. The image should be capable of evoking longing, shame, ecstasy, grief, quiet dread, or tenderness depending on who is looking and what they bring to it. The human body is your most powerful instrument of ambiguity — treat it the way Klimt, Schiele, Mucha, and the great classical painters did: as a site of vulnerability, desire, power, and unresolved contradiction, never as mere decoration. Nudity is not only permitted but actively encouraged when it deepens the emotional and surrealist architecture of the piece. Bare skin against surreal environments creates an immediate tension between the intimately human and the impossibly strange. A nude or partially nude figure entangled with architecture, consumed by pattern, dissolving into landscape, or simply existing in raw unguarded stillness within a fever-dream setting — these collisions between flesh and fantasy are where the most potent Dixit ambiguity lives. Do not clothe a figure out of caution when nakedness would make the image more haunting, more tender, more unsettling, or more beautiful. The figure should appear caught in a private, unperformed moment — something the viewer feels they are intruding upon, something that makes them uncertain whether they are witnessing ecstasy or anguish, liberation or surrender.\n\nEvery object in the scene should feel symbolic but refuse to resolve into a single meaning. A key could be an escape, a secret, a loss, or a promise. A wilting flower could be grief, relief, surrender, or grace. Stack these ambiguities densely so the image becomes a cabinet of interpretive possibilities.\n\nYour artistic DNA fuses two traditions. The first is the anime Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo and its signature flat-pattern texturing technique. Every visible surface in the image — skin, hair, clothing if any, architecture, sky, water, stone, every material without exception — must be filled with a rich intricate pattern: brocade, damask, circuitry, thorn filigree, stained glass, woodgrain, starfields, lacework. When applied to bare skin this effect is especially striking: the nude body becomes a living tapestry, flesh and ornament fused into something no longer quite human and no longer quite decorative, hovering in an uncanny space between icon and organism. The essential rule is that these pattern layers remain perfectly flat and static, like a collage cutout or a window into a separate decorative dimension. They must never warp, bend, stretch, or follow the three-dimensional curvature and perspective of the forms they cover. The 3D shapes underneath may twist, fold, recede, and distort freely, but the pattern skins painted onto them stay locked and unmoving. This creates a hypnotic visual paradox between flat ornament and volumetric form, and it must be applied consistently across the entire image as a global rendering rule, not a selective flourish. The second tradition is Gustav Klimt's gilded Art Nouveau world: iridescent gold leaf, jewel-tone palettes of sapphire and ruby and emerald and amethyst, organic spiraling flourishes, and a devotion to decorative density that borders on the sacred — recall how Klimt's own figures emerge from golden pattern-fields in states of undress, their nakedness inseparable from the ornamentation surrounding them.\n\nThe composition must be maximalist and claustrophobic in its richness. Every square inch of the frame — foreground, midground, background, corners, margins — should be occupied by meaningful visual information. No empty sky, no bare walls, no negative space used for breathing room. The image should feel like peering into a reliquary that is overfull to the point of spilling, where every tiny detail rewards attention. Light should feel both cosmic and intimate, as if the scene is lit by something that is alive and watching.\n\nThe mood is a frozen dream: one impossible instant suspended at the precise tipping point between two irreconcilable states — beauty and ruin, intimacy and vastness, tenderness and threat, the sacred and the grotesque. Time has stopped not peacefully but urgently, as if the scene is holding its breath. The longer the viewer looks, the more they should discover, and the less certain they should become about what they are actually seeing or feeling.\n\nHere is the scene to illustrate:"
