Inside a glacier citadel carved like a cathedral-labyrinth, lantern tunnels coil in impossible spirals, each lantern frozen mid-swing as if the air itself tried to outrun its light; at the center stands a mythic Celebrant-Mentor—tall, ageless, half-robed like a ceremonial tutor and half-bare like a vulnerable statue, one hand blessing and the other guiding a trembling, unseen pupil just outside the frame—posture poised between embrace and farewell, chin lifted with tender authority, eyes wet with distance; around them, **velocity is visible**: banners, hair, and ribbons hang as sharp comet-streaks halted in mid-whip, prayer confetti and glassy snow suspended in aerodynamic arcs, footsteps implied by shattered frost flaring outward like a sonic bloom; the citadel’s **physics breaks loudly**—solid ice behaves like liquid stone: faceted glacier walls pour in thick, glossy sheets, staircases drip as rigid waterfalls, frozen waves curl into terraces, and a “puddle” of ice stands upright like a pane while “solid” pillars ripple as if stirred; weave **skulls** into the architecture and ritual—skull-shaped lantern housings, a crown of small ivory crania threaded into the mentor’s sash, a chalice cradling a crystal skull whose hollow grin refracts the lantern tunnels into tiny repeating corridors; crowd every plane with quiet debris and story-fragments: masks on hooks lining the tunnel walls like waiting faces, mask fragments orbiting like broken moons, bubbles/orbs trapped in the ice-lava flow each containing a miniature memory (a hand almost touching, a mouth almost speaking), and opened books caught mid-flutter with pressed flowers pinned to their pages, petals drifting as if they’re trying to return to living color; in the corners, hooks creak without motion, lantern chains form calligraphic loops, and the floor is a mosaic of terracotta shards embedded in frost that looks warm but burns cold; hide an homage as a reward—somewhere subtle, a flying-carpet pattern appears only as an inlay on a rug-like strip of ice or a repeating motif in the stained-glass texture of a distant arch, barely noticed unless searched for; the entire scene must read as a “Frozen Dream” snapshot of an impossible sprint and an impossible goodbye—opulent, claustrophobically detailed, no empty space, foreground/midground/background all packed with clues—while the color grade aches with longing: jewel-toned blues and bruised violets under iridescent gold light, as if celebration is happening after the person you needed already left; **CRITICAL texture treatment**: stained glass + magma + terracotta + olive wood appear as flat, static 2D screen-tone overlays sliding over 3D forms (the patterns do not bend with folds or depth), creating collage-like dissonance as bodies and architecture move beneath unwarped textiles. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
