A mythic Elder sits at the heart of an impossible labyrinth-palace, spine perfectly upright yet subtly tired, bare feet on a dais made of interlocked domino tiles; their face is half serene, half undone, the skin patterned with flat, unmoving screen-tone overlays of **clouds and antique maps** that ignore every curve and fold as if pasted on a moving statue. Around them, corridors knot into themselves like a brain’s maze: staircases loop back into their own bannisters, doorways open onto the same doorway, and the walls behave as **solid liquidity**—marble flows in slow frozen waves, water holds rigid as cut crystal, and honey becomes a geometric arch that drips upward into sharp facets, all paused mid-transformation. A sealed **love letter** is nailed to the air at the exact center of the composition (the one truly static thing), while time performs **circular choreography** around it: echo-images of the Elder’s hands in sequential beats, orbiting dice caught in repeated positions, trails of game tokens and pomegranate seeds forming a halo like a thought you can’t finish. In the corners, cluttered with meaning, syrup trails crawl across the ceiling like constellations; pomegranate seeds float like red punctuation; toppled dice show contradictory numbers; dominoes cascade yet never land. The **Simurgh** is physically present—an opulent bird woven into the architecture and also emerging from the Elder’s cloak as a second silhouette, beak delicately holding the letter’s torn ribbon—its feathers rendered as flat cloud-map collage that refuses perspective. Whimsical, playful lighting: jewel-toned glow, iridescent gold flicker, absurdly elegant chaos, no empty space anywhere, every inch a riddle.
