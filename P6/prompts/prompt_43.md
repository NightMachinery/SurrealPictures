Telephoto-compressed, crowded frame inside a ruined zoo repurposed into communal workshops: shattered Art Deco cages become loom-frames, kilns, and communal tables; cracked signage (“AVIARY”, “REPTILES”) hangs like torn scripture while every plane is stacked with hands, tools, and relics. At the choking center stands a mythic Chef—tall, exhausted, and luminous—half in ceremonial whites stitched from old circus banners, half bare like a classical statue revealed mid-confession; a heavy apron patterned with childish drawing-paper motifs (scribbled suns, first letters, innocent stains) hangs like a priestly stole. Their posture is a frozen bow of gratitude: one hand pressed to the sternum, the other offering a ladle as if it were a chalice; inside the ladle, milk-white light swirls into a perfect, untouched pearl that refuses to spill. Above and behind them, physics breaks violently: the sky is descending into the zoo—constellations and moon-fragments sink like chandeliers, planets falling as slow, immaculate fruit, a cathedral of night collapsing downward in a paused avalanche; starlight becomes ribbons that wrap cages, workbenches, and wrists, binding strangers together in shared craft. The Simurgh is physically present and everywhere: a vast mosaic Simurgh erupts through a crumbled aviary wall, its feather-tiles missing and replaced by workshop scraps; a living Simurgh silhouette is cut from gold leaf and nailed as a signboard over the communal ovens; a small Simurgh-shaped pastry stamp is clenched between the Chef’s fingers like a secret key; its shadow forms a second bird that doesn’t match the body. Innocence/purity is shown as contamination reversed: soot-black bricks bloom into white blossoms where gratitude falls; rusted bars turn to ivory at the touch of shared hands; a childlike paper crown, pristine, floats unburned through ash. Environmental debris saturates every corner—fallen crowns and tiara shards caught in hair and gears, loose pearls draped across broken necklaces like spilled prayers, ripe fruit split open on mosaic floors (pomegranates, figs, berries) with seeds suspended mid-air like tiny planets; jeweled fragments orbit the Chef’s feet as if the ground itself is thanking them. Decorative border motifs invade the interior like a living frame: Klimt-like gilded vines and zoo-map cartouches creep over faces, tools, and rubble; mosaic panels and diptych seams slice the scene into stacked posters; labels, receipts, and recipe margins collage into halos. Color and light feel like overflowing thanks—warm iridescent gold, tender jewel tones, soft radiant highlights that make the ruin look forgiven—yet the faces in the crowded planes are ambiguous, reverent, hungry, guilty, saved; everyone looks upward at the descending heaven while the Chef looks downward, as if purity is heavier than the sky. Ensure the “Gankutsuou” texture rule: watercolor-and-ink screen-tone patterns remain perfectly flat (not bending with folds) over 3D bodies, rubble, and falling celestial objects, creating a paradoxical collage skin on everything. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
