A crowded rooftop festival quarter at blue hour, every roofline stitched to the next by sagging kite-bridges and prayer-string bunting; lanterns shaped like miniature hourglasses glow from within, their sand replaced by pale sugar dust that hangs frozen mid-spill. Center frame: a mythic Beast—tall, broad, almost regal—crouched on a gilded parapet like a cathedral gargoyle that learned to mourn; a lion’s skull softened by human tenderness, velvet antlers threaded with wax seals and signet rings, one bare shoulder and ribcage exposed like a classical statue unfinished, skin simultaneously majestic and unsettling. The Beast cradles an enormous cracked hourglass against its chest as if offering it in gratitude, yet its gaze pulls past the viewer toward a distant rooftop it cannot reach, longing made visible as a thin filament of light stretched across the kite-bridges like a vein. The grotesque/uncanny manifests in the environment: festival masks on the crowd below are worn by empty air, sleeves applauding without arms; street food steam forms anatomical diagrams; confetti is salt crystals that sparkle like teeth; every surface is over-ornamented and slightly wrong—stamps embedded in brick, wax seals blooming like wounds on banners, origami birds perched in impossible places (on eyelids, on keyholes, on the rim of the hourglass) while more birds hover mid-fold in the air. The defining impossibility: shadow autonomy—every figure’s shadow is detached, standing upright and acting independently; the Beast’s shadow is the true protagonist, towering behind it as a second Beast made of ink and velvet darkness, gently unwrapping the Beast’s gift and stepping across rooftops without a body, while smaller shadows pick pockets, exchange sealed letters, and pull kite-bridges tighter like puppet strings; even lantern shadows drift upward like smoke. Apply a flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone overlay of **marble & moss** across all forms (skin, fabric, rooftops, shadows, birds), refusing to bend with curvature—collage-patterns sliding beneath the anatomy, static textiles pasted over depth. Foreground corners packed: spilled sugar dust on mosaic tiles; a ring of broken wax seals; a cluster of tiny origami birds nesting in a cracked teacup; stamp-marked invitations fluttering but suspended. Midground packed: dancers frozen mid-twirl on adjacent roofs, their autonomous shadows bowing in a different direction; kite-bridges dense with hanging hourglasses, charms, seals, and salt-crystal tassels. Background packed: stacked rooftops like an ornate amphitheater of windows, no empty sky—only layered patterns, banners, and distant silhouettes; a far-off rooftop altar glowing with unreachable warmth. Lighting/color-grade: jewel-toned opulence with iridescent gold highlights; warm gratitude radiating from lantern-hourglasses and the Beast’s offering hand, countered by cool longing pooling in the spaces between bridges; cinematic depth, razor-sharp detail everywhere, paradoxical tenderness in a grotesque carnival, frozen mid-catastrophe and mid-blessing. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
