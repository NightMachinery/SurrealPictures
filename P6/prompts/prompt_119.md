Centered one-point perspective down a basalt causeway carved into a monolithic black coast, every edge throwing aggressive depth lines toward a vanishing point that is not a point but a ragged, vertical portal-slit: a displacement tear where the far background has slid into the foreground like a misprinted collage—aurora-lit ocean surf hangs midair inside the tear while a cathedral of basalt columns has been dragged through it and now floats behind the viewer, visible *in front* of the subject as if space has been folded inside-out; at the exact axis stands the Matchmaker-Vessel, mythic and intimate, a tall androgynous figure with classical, sensual nudity partially veiled by a ceremonial mantle made from stitched vows (threaded with spools as beads), posture unwavering—feet planted on wet stone, torso slightly arched as if containing two heartbeats, one hand offering a loop of red thread, the other hand pressed to their abdomen where a translucent amphora-womb glows with mingling silhouettes (two lovers, two enemies, two selves) fused into a single ember; their face is calm with determined, stoic strength, yet the eyes brim with explosive vitality, as if refusing to blink during an impact; the “first blossom” exists physically as a single impossible flower sprouting from a seam in their sternum—petals like fresh paper, stamens like gold needles—while smaller first-blossoms bud along the basalt cracks and inside the portal’s ripped border, suggesting the world itself is being married to its own wound; the air is saturated and crowded: origami boats and paper ships spiral in violent, frozen eddies around the figure, some wet and collapsing into ink, others pristine and sharp like prayers; songbirds in flight are paused mid-beat everywhere (corners included), their wings forming arrows that point to hidden unions—pairs mirroring pairs—some birds sewn shut with visible stitches, some trailing loose threads that braid together into a single cord vanishing into the portal; sewing needles rain without falling, aligned like a metallic constellation, piercing paper hulls and basalt alike, each needle catching aurora light and reflecting it as green-violet fire; thread spools tumble in the foreground puddles, their unwinding lines drawing planar geometry over the scene like fate-diagrams, binding boats to birds, blossom to wound, subject to horizon, horizon to viewer; the coast is not empty but congested with watching motifs—basalt faces carved into the columns, cameo profiles in negative space, mirrored silhouettes of embracing strangers embedded in stone grain—an audience of mute witnesses framing the protagonist like a living proscenium; lighting is aurora-strong and theatrical (jewel-toned greens, magentas, and electric blues rim-lighting gold highlights), with a warm internal sunrise emanating from the subject’s vessel-body and first blossom, casting contradictory shadows that fall *toward* the viewer while the portal casts shadows *away*; apply a strict Gankutsuou collage effect: a flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone overlay of “honey & sunlight” (hexagonal honeycomb lattices, liquid-gold marbling, sun-dappled speckle) plastered across skin, stone, cloth, birds, and debris, refusing to bend with folds or depth so the 3D forms slide beneath a static textile pattern; no empty space anywhere—foreground cluttered with wet paper, needles, and coiled thread, midground packed with frozen flight and spiraling boats, background crowded with basalt architecture and aurora curtains—every detail implying an impossible union mid-event, a vow being tied while the world is displaced through itself. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
