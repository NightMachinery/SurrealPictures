Extreme low-angle portrait from the cold stone floor of a vast alchemy academy-labyrinth, where suspended furnace towers hang like inverted cathedrals on chains of etched steel and the vaulted architecture folds back into itself in blatant infinite recursion: a furnace doorway contains a smaller copy of the entire academy, which contains another, and so on, each iteration visible as nested diorama-rooms inside crystal watching-orbs drifting through the air; at the center, the Dreamer—mythic, ageless, androgynous—balances in a frozen mid-fall posture on a spiraling Möbius staircase of brass pages and bone-white chalk equations, one knee bent as if landing, spine arched in ecstatic surrender, face tilted upward in blissful terror, lips parted as if tasting light, with classical artistic nudity partly revealed beneath a ceremonial half-robe and corset-harness of alchemical straps; their skin and garments are overlaid with the Gankutsuou “lace & steel” effect as a flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone collage pattern that ignores folds and depth (the body seems to move under a static lacework and riveted steel filigree mask), while iridescent gold leaf halos their silhouette; a living Minotaur is physically present as both guardian and architecture—its horned head emerges from a gilded relief in a monumental arch, yet its hooves stand on the floor beside the Dreamer, creating an uncanny split existence—and its labyrinthine nostrils exhale perfume-smoke that becomes fluttering butterflies pinned midair by jeweled brooches; the Derafsh Kaviani is present as a torn imperial standard doubling as a vertical banner and a scaffold, threaded through the towers and gripped in the Dreamer’s hand like a staff, its jewel-studded squares reflecting countless tiny copies of the Dreamer looking back; grotesque/uncanny details crowd every corner without respite: crucibles with smiling teeth, retorts filled with eyes instead of liquid, chandeliers made of delicate vertebrae and lace gloves, abandoned silk stockings looping around gears like ceremonial snakes, butterfly pins embedded in stone like holy shrapnel, watching orbs peering from shelves, floor cracks, and the Dreamer’s shadow; ecstatic (transcendent bliss) atmosphere—jewel-tone radiance, opalescent steam, warm furnace glow shot through with cool moonlight—turns the horror tender, as if everything is celebrating the impossibility; subtle easter egg for “memory erasure as a second death” hidden as a half-erased portrait sigil woven into a rug’s ornate border and a small locket on a cluttered desk whose face has been meticulously scratched blank, nearly lost among stacked grimoires, sigil-stamps, and repeating nested models of the same room; maximalist foreground/midground/background density, no empty space, every surface patterned, engraved, or inhabited, the entire frame a crowded visual riddle paused at the instant before impact. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
