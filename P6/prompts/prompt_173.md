A frozen dream frame inside a carnival-circus necropolis: phosphor-green ticket booths glow like bioluminescent confessionals between mausoleum tents and funhouse crypts, their signage written in half-erased prayers; at the center stands a mythic Therapist—tall, androgynous, serene and heavy with witness—bare shoulders and throat exposed like classical statuary, draped in a ceremonial coat whose surface is a **flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone overlay of constellations and black void** that refuses to follow folds or anatomy (the body shifts beneath it, the pattern stays rigid and collage-flat), one gloved hand offering an impossible “session” with a cracked hand-mirror and a string of ticket stubs like rosary beads, the other hand gripping the **Derafsh Kaviani** as a living standard woven into the architecture (its tassels become marquee fringe, its jeweled sun-disc bolted into a booth canopy, its ribbons lacing around gravestones like veins). Above, physics breaks loudly: a **celestial descent** where the night sky has detached and is falling into the scene—constellations as heavy ornaments, a chandelier of planets, zodiac frescoes peeling off the heavens like wallpaper slabs, star-motes turning into cold metal teeth mid-fall—everything suspended mid-collapse, silent, perfectly still, as if time is holding its breath. The grotesque/uncanny lives in the details: laughing carnival masks nailed to ossuary doors; a carousel of skeletal horses wearing childlike party hats; therapy couches stitched from mourning veils; cotton-candy spun from funeral ash; cherubic mannequins with too-many joints offering balloons shaped like internal organs, all rendered with tender wonder rather than horror. Crowd every inch with drifting debris and quiet symbols: **open empty birdcages** tumbling in the foreground with doors yawning like unanswered questions; **fallen crowns and tiara shards** scattered across marble confetti, caught in midair beside **floating feathers** that thread through booth lights like snow; shattered lollipops embedded in headstones; ticket punches orbiting like insects; a ringmaster’s top hat filled with teeth; tiny ghostly audience silhouettes pressed against booth windows as if waiting their turn to be understood. Hide the homage subtly: a small **seeing stone** (a triangle with a hole) appears as an incidental charm on the Therapist’s wrist chain or as a worn cutout in a patterned rug beneath the couch—visible only on close inspection. Lighting and color grade radiate childlike discovery—jewel-toned phosphor glow, iridescent gold highlights, candy-bright chiaroscuro—yet every object hints at an emotional riddle: is the Therapist summoning the falling sky, or holding it back, or listening to it confess?
