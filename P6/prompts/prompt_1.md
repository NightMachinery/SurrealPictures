Frozen-dream tableau inside a tiered **medical theater turned ceremonial observatory**: velvet operating benches become altar-steps, brass astrolabes and orreries interlock with ribbed anatomical arches, and stained-glass oculi project impossible constellations onto flayed lecture curtains of velvet night. At the center stands **The Shadow**—a mythic, human-shaped absence with the gravity of a judge and an executioner, posture perfectly upright yet leaning as if listening to a confession; their attire is a half-unfastened surgeon’s cloak fused to a monastic stole, exposing glimpses of vulnerable, classical nude anatomy that never fully resolves, because their **face is erased** into a polished void. **Portal displacement** fractures the scene: their hands emerge from hovering circular portals in the wrong places (one reaching from behind the viewer’s “nowhere” to tip a scalpel, another appearing inside a glass vitrine to cradle an eye-shaped pearl), while their detached shadow steps out of a portal on the ceiling and falls upward into an open star-map; the body remains frozen, but the geometry implies motion everywhere. **The taboo** is made physical—sealed anatomy texts stitched with censor bars, forbidden diagrams of pleasure and punishment, surgical instruments arranged like sacramental relics around a glowing, unlabelled specimen jar that contains an ecstatic sunrise; the room itself reacts as if complicit, with seat-backs turning into clasped hands and telescopes blushing with heated gold. The **Scales of Justice** are unavoidable and riddling: one scale is embedded in the observatory dome like a lunar phase, another is held by the Shadow’s displaced hand, weighing a living heart against a blackened wedding ring; the chains thread through portals, so the verdict seems decided in another room. Crowded foreground debris: **loose pearls** skitter and float in slow arcs, **broken necklaces** coil like shed serpents across tiles, and **moss-lit bioluminescent mushrooms** sprout from surgical drains, illuminating spilled sutures and star charts; in every corner, **dancing silhouettes**—flat, cutout celebrants—waltz on the walls as if the theater itself is applauding a forbidden operation. Atmosphere is **transcendent ecstasy**: jewel-toned radiance, gold-leaf glints like holy sweat, blissful light blooming from incision-lines in the architecture, with no empty space—every seat occupied by a mask, every railing draped in chain, every shadow hiding a second mouth of a portal. **CRITICAL texture behavior**: Persian tilework, lapis lazuli, stained-glass, and magma patterns appear as a static 2D screen-tone overlay on all 3D forms (skin, cloth, metal, fungi, portals), remaining perfectly flat and unwarped while bodies and objects exist beneath it, creating a luxurious collage paradox where surface refuses depth. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
