A frozen instant inside a **sunken observatory** half-swallowed by black seawater and velvet silt: brass astrolabes, cracked mosaics, and barnacle-crowned telescopes crowd every inch, while **whales glide impossibly through the glass domes** as if the domes are not there—each leviathan carrying constellations of old lovers’ names in glowing plankton on its skin; at the center stands **The Romantist**, mythic and exhausted with blinding joy, a tall and androgynous figure posed like a classical statue mid-confession—bare shoulders and collarbones exposed, an open embroidered coat sliding off one hip like a surrendered secret, one hand pressed to the sternum and the other offering a small, impossible relic: a **theater ticket that unfolds into a star map of childhood**; their face is both smiling and grieving (euphoria with tears), eyes reflecting a thousand tiny scenes like broken mirrors. **Displacement is violently literal**: the observatory’s architecture is “cut-and-pasted” out of place—staircases hang sideways, a doorway floats where a ceiling should be, and entire **chunks of floor drift as floating islands/rocks** with chairs still bolted to them; gravity has multiple directions at once, so **torn programs**, **theater tickets**, **teacups and saucers**, and ornate picture frames hover in dense spirals, yet everything is perfectly still as if paused mid-explosion. The air is thick with **memory/nostalgia** made physical: translucent ribbon-like filmstrips wrap around pillars, faded love letters become schools of paper fish, Polaroids drift like jellyfish, and a giant cracked clock face lies submerged, its hands replaced by two entwined fingers; in the far background, a mural-wall is a living archive—painted faces peeling into actual masks that float forward, each mask smiling too brightly. The **Simurgh** is present as the key to the puzzle: a radiant, many-feathered bird-form forged from gilded filigree and stained-glass fragments perched atop the central orrery, wings half-open like a cathedral, its feathers shaped like tiny ticket stubs and comet tails; its shadow falls upward onto the dome, becoming a second, inverted Simurgh made of bubbles and starlight. **Gankutsuou texture mandate**: apply **flat, static 2D screen-tone overlays** of **Fire & Ice** (flame motifs and crystalline frost motifs) across coats, skin, whales, stone, and floating debris—patterns remain perfectly planar and do **not** follow folds or perspective, creating a collage mismatch against the 3D forms beneath. Lighting is euphoric and overwhelming—prismatic gold rays cut through seawater from nowhere, turning dust into glitter, making every edge jewel-bright; corners are packed with micro-narratives (a teacup pouring upward into a tiny galaxy, a torn program used as a bandage on a statue, a floating island with a bed from a different life). Hide a subtle homage: a small rug fragment draped over a rail or wedged in a rock crevice, its weave forming a **flying carpet pattern** that only the attentive notice, never central. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
