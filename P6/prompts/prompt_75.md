At the exact center of a tilted, one-point-perspective corridor-palace suspended above the clouds, an inverted waterfall pours upward into the ceiling like a ribbon of impossible gravity—yet the “water” is mechanical nature: glittering clockwork minnows, leaf-shaped brass plates, and piston-jointed foam frozen mid-surge, each droplet a tiny gear caught in the act of becoming a bird; in the vanishing point stands the Idol, mythic and unblinking, an androgynous near-nude figure posed like a cathedral statue yet leaning forward with childlike curiosity, chin lifted, one finger almost touching a floating question-mark made of interlocked escapements, the other hand cradling the Lyre of Orpheus as if it’s both instrument and key, its strings threaded into the palace architecture and disappearing into distant arches; their skin and garments are opulently collaged with the Gankutsuou effect—feathers-and-tar screen-tone patterns lying FLAT across their silhouette like pasted paper (the pattern does not wrap or bend with muscles or folds; the body moves beneath it), creating paradoxical depth under a stubbornly 2D textile veneer; the palace is crowded to suffocation: tilework packed with tiny doorways that open onto miniature prosceniums, each doorway spilling torn theater programs and punched tickets that hover in a suspended debris flow, corners stuffed with broken clock gears, jeweled filigree, and ornate Art Nouveau columns that sprout mechanical vines; foreground: a carpet of shattered gilt cogs and soggy playbills, a masked cherub-automaton tugging mischievously at the Idol’s trailing sash, a half-open door in the floor revealing clouds like an underworld; midground: upside-down balconies where laughing shadow-silhouettes applaud silently, their applause implied by repeated “echo” hands drawn in sequential beats; background: the waterfall-palace births and consumes itself in layered arches, aggressive depth lines converging so hard they feel like a trap, while gold light misbehaves—spotlighting secrets, casting prankish kaleidoscope shadows, turning curiosity into a gleeful trouble that dares the viewer to step closer; nothing rests—everything is paused mid-fall, mid-rise, mid-note, a frozen dream packed edge-to-edge with clues that refuse a single meaning.
