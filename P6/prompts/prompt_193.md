A frozen-dream tableau on a funerary avenue: an endless corridor of mausoleum façades and silent wrought-iron balconies stacked like ribs, each balcony hosting unmoving masked mourners whose shadows are displaced onto the wrong walls, while entire sections of architecture hover a few feet to the left of where they “should” be—doors opening into air, stairways arriving at nothing, chandeliers hanging under the street, a hearse roof drifting above its own wheels; at the center stands **The Host**, mythic and intimate, an androgynous figure half-clothed in ceremonial brocade that slips like confession, posture calm but weighted (one hand extended in welcome, the other pressed to the sternum as if keeping a heart from escaping), skin and garments overlaid with a **flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone collage pattern of obsidian veining split by white lightning filigree** that ignores every fold and contour (the body moves beneath it, but the pattern remains stubbornly planar); their eyes hold compassionate warmth, casting a healing amber-pink glow that softens the grotesque—yet the glow reveals the uncanny truth: teeth embedded like pearls in the balcony railings, clockwork tendons threading through lampposts, and petals that look bruised; a **lotus** blooms from the Host’s open palm, but its roots are inked text-lines torn from a book, pages fluttering as pressed flowers leak color back into the air, while a living **chimera** is woven into the avenue itself—lion flank in mosaic, goat horn in gilded ornament, serpent tail as a curling balustrade—its many eyes closed as if being soothed; the street is crowded with environmental debris in layered depth: broken clock gears the size of coins and the size of halos, suspended mid-fall; cracked vials and tiny flasks of luminous elixirs drifting like reluctant fireflies; book pages with pressed flowers pinwheeling past the Host’s shoulders; mourners’ gloved hands offering empty corks; in the corners, funerary wreaths become anatomical diagrams, and the sky is not above but *between* balconies, displaced into the negative spaces like a misfiled memory; the compassion is palpable but paradoxical—comfort offered in a place that cannot keep its own geometry—so the scene reads as a ritual of healing performed inside a beautiful error; hide, as an almost-noticed reward, a **black cat in a cage** as a small balcony trinket (a gilt birdcage behind lace curtains, nearly lost among flowers and gears), its silhouette echoing the chimera’s tail.
