Inside a collapsed opera house whose cracked proscenium has fallen into a cathedral of velvet rubble, the air is thick with phosphorescent ivy that crawls over gilded balconies and broken chandeliers, blooming like quiet lanterns; the entire scene is frozen mid-exchange: a mythic therapist—tall, ageless, and quietly exhausted—stands barefoot on a fractured stage that is partitioned into a single frame’s **triptych** by three hanging, torn curtains of brocade and ivy, each “panel” revealing a different facet of the same instant. In the center partition, the therapist’s posture is an offering and a boundary at once: one **open hand** extended toward the viewer, palm up, holding a small, impossible “receipt” made of stitched confetti and medical notes; the other hand gently cups an **Achilles’ heel** (their own, vulnerable, tendon exposed as a jeweled seam) as if treating a wound that is also a lock—an exchange of pain for permission. Around them, physics breaks loudly through **fluid solidity**: spilled honey/syrup trails ribbon across the stage and into the seats, but each droplet has crystallized into amber glass mid-drip, while elsewhere the honey behaves like stone—weighty, stacked, forming steps and shackles—yet still gleams wet; tears on the therapist’s cheek are frozen as heavy pearls that cast warm light. The therapist’s attire is half-ritual, half-clinical: a loose robe slipping off one shoulder like a surrendered confession, skin rendered classical and vulnerable, while their silhouette is overlaid with the strict **Gankutsuou “feathers & tar” screen-tone collage**—a flat 2D pattern that refuses to follow anatomy or folds, sliding over the 3D body like a pasted textile label, feathers interlaced with tar-black blotches that remain perfectly planar even across bending limbs. The exchange theme multiplies through crowded details: open, empty **birdcages** drift and tumble through every depth layer like discarded promises, their doors yawning; confetti and streamers whirl in suspended spirals, but the streamers are also torn sheet music and therapy transcripts; a cracked mask trades faces with a bandaged foot; a velvet seat cushions a beating heart-shaped metronome; and the ivy appears to “barter” light, glowing brighter wherever compassion lands. In the left partition, a river of solidified honey climbs upward like a staircase into the balcony, carrying tiny floating cages and a swarm of gold leaf motes; in the right partition, the opera’s ruined chandelier hangs mid-fall, its crystals replaced by viscous tar droplets that paradoxically shine, while the therapist’s open palm casts a healing warmth that makes the ivy fluoresce in gentle gradients. Fill every corner with occluding debris—broken mirrors, overturned seats, drifting cages, ivy tendrils, confetti caught in tar, honey-glass trails bridging foreground to background—no clean horizons, only layered depth and visual riddles; hide a **single lost slipper** as a destiny key, subtly embedded as a faint slipper-shaped motif in the torn rug pattern near the stage edge, half-swallowed by ivy and nearly mistaken for ornament.
