A wide, panoramic **vertical** view from the lowest aisle of an **aurora amphitheater carved into cathedral-like glacier arches**, the frame stacked in dense spatial layers (foreground debris almost touching the lens, mid-tier stage action, background tiers collapsing upward into impossible architecture), every surface crowded with ornament and meaning: at the center-stage stands a mythic **Artisan–Celebrant**, an androgynous master craftsperson with a festival crown half-forged, half-flowering, torso bare in vulnerable classical nudity under a heavy ceremonial cloak, posture both offering and resisting—one hand chiseling a jeweled mask, the other raising a chalice that spills **honey/syrup** into glowing ribbons that defy gravity, looping into a sensual **infinity** around their hips and wrists like liquid vows; their expression is tenderly amused, eyes wet with devotion, as if passion itself is a craft they are failing beautifully. The amphitheater is a paradox engine of **infinite recursion**: the stage contains a smaller amphitheater where the same Artisan–Celebrant performs the same gesture, and within that an even smaller one, and so on—an explicit nested-doll vista of repeating arches and repeating bodies, each iteration slightly different (a mask becomes a lock, a lock becomes a mouth, a mouth becomes a keyhole), the recursion climbing the vertical stack until it disappears into aurora curtains and crystalline haze; even the audience is recursive—tiers of spectators are revealed to be paper cutout silhouettes of the protagonist watching themselves watch themselves. A **Burning Bush** is physically present as the totem and the riddle: a shrub growing from a split in the ice, its “flames” made of luminous paper petals and gold-ink tongues that do not consume the leaves, casting playful, theatrical light like footlights; the Artisan’s cloak is pinned with a small sprig from it, as if wearing a dangerous blessing. The air is thick with **floating keys and locks** (some antique brass, some carved from ice, some folded from paper), **torn theater tickets and shredded programs** spinning like confetti, and honey-glossed ribbons that glue them together into accidental constellations; corners are busy with tiny side-stories—an ice cherub trying to lick syrup off a padlock, a pair of gloves applauding without hands, a masquerade mask growing roots into a ticket stub. The glacier arches loom like a ribcage and a proscenium at once, packed with Art Nouveau carvings, mosaic inlays, and hidden faces; the aurora behaves like stage drapery caught mid-swish, frozen in a whimsical, playful absurdity that still feels intimate and adult, as if the whole amphitheater is flirting with the viewer. **CRUCIAL Gankutsuou texture rule:** apply origami/paper screen-tone patterns as a flat, static 2D overlay across all 3D forms (skin, ice, honey, keys, flames), the patterns staying unmoving and unbent while bodies and objects imply depth beneath—collage-like, paradoxical, richly patterned; no empty space anywhere, maximalist clutter in every tier, with sharp foreground detail, dense midground action, and a background that is still packed with recursive stages and aurora architecture. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
