A crowded, claustrophobic “floating customs office for dream travelers” suspended in a black-indigo void with no horizon—only layered catwalks, visa booths, hanging lanterns, pneumatic tubes, and baroque filing cabinets that bloom into architectural ribs; in the center stands a mythic Mentor as the chief customs adjudicator, tall and ageless, an androgynous classical body partly nude beneath a severe, collar-high mantle that hangs like a judge’s robe yet clings like wet stone, posture unwavering (one hand raised in a silent halt, the other pressing a heavy seal to an invisible document), eyes calm with stoic determination as if teaching by refusal; the entire scene is a frozen pause: sound itself is confiscated—speech bubbles are present but turned to glass, a bell mid-swing is stopped in mid-air without ringing, a queue of masked travelers remains motionless with passports half-open, breath suspended as pearled condensation, ink droplets hovering above stamp pads like planets; physics is shattered in an unmistakable soft-sculpture / fluid-solidity event—walls made of “liquid marble” pour downward in velvet folds yet remain rigid as pillars, mercury streams coil into solid ribbon-staircases, luggage becomes pliant porcelain slumping over benches while still reflecting light like polished stone, and a tidal sheet of moonlit metal is caught mid-surge, forming a throne-like wave behind the Mentor; the Simurgh is physically present as a totem and key: a colossal many-feathered bird emblem wrought into the customs archway with jeweled eyes, its wings doubling as gate mechanisms, while a smaller Simurgh-shaped stamp/seal is clutched in the Mentor’s hand and a living Simurgh silhouette flickers inside a prism drop like a trapped oath; fill every corner with drifting debris and visual riddles—clusters of bubbles/orbs and marbles/glass beads orbit the figures like confiscated thoughts, prism drops rain in slow motion catching fragmented faces, loose calendar pages and falling date sheets spiral through the air with stamped “APPROVED / DENIED” marks, torn tickets, wax seals, and thin ribbons of red tape curling around ankles; layer foreground, midground, and background with dense signage in invented alphabets, stacked shelves of dream-contraband (bottled lullabies, folded shadows, keys made of ice), and surveillance mirrors that reflect slightly different moments of the same pause; lighting and color grade radiate determined restraint—cold moonlight and mercury glints edged with gold, jewel tones constrained like a vow, everything opulent yet tense; **CRUCIAL Gankutsuou texture directive**: overlay mercury-and-moonlight screen-tone patterns as flat, static 2D collage textures across robes, skin, metal, walls, and fluids—patterns do not bend with folds or depth, remaining planar while the 3D forms exist beneath, amplifying the paradoxical stillness; make the composition maximalist, zero empty space, a visual puzzle that asks what was stopped, what was permitted, and what the Mentor refuses to let move again. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
