A crowded vertical 2:3 illustration of a funerary avenue lined with silent wrought-iron balconies, every railing crowded with bone-white lilies, ossuary niches, and skull-shaped lanterns; in the center stands **the Beast**—a mythic, gender-ambiguous chimera with leonine shoulders, a cathedral-stag crown, and human hands worn raw from carrying invisible burdens—caught in a “frozen dream” mid-step as if a colossal weight has just slid off its spine, posture slackening into **relief** (a soft exhale made visible), eyes half-closed in grateful disbelief. Its skin, mane, and draped ceremonial cloth are overlaid with **flat, unmoving lace-and-steel screen-tone patterns**—filigreed lace grids and cold riveted metal motifs that stay perfectly 2D and static across curves and folds, collage-like, while the 3D body beneath implies motion. The grotesque/uncanny soul of the scene blooms through contradictions: balconies that resemble mouths sewn shut, staircases that spiral upward and also downward into the same doorway, and skulls embedded everywhere—skull door-knockers, skull paving stones, a skull chalice in the Beast’s palm—yet the lighting is tender, jewel-toned, and weight-lifted, as if dawn has forgiven the street. The defining impossibility is **sensory synesthesia made violent and obvious**: sound is visible as pearly ribbons of calligraphy-like “notes” that drip like honey and shatter into glass, while colors ring like bells—every hue emits tiny chimes; perfumes become luminous fog that forms geometric choirs; the Beast’s exhale releases a silent *clang* rendered as a bright gold ripple. Swarms of **tiny bells, ankle-chimes, and broken anklets** float like insects around the Beast’s ankles and wrists, each bell casting a small halo of audible color; bioluminescent fungi and moss-lit mushrooms sprout from cracks in coffins, from balcony planters, and from the Beast’s footprints, glowing teal and violet, illuminating hidden skulls in the cobbles. Encode time as **sequential action beats arranged like storyboard panels**: fractured panel-borders made of lace and steel slice the composition into overlapping moments—echoed silhouettes of the Beast appear three times (the burdened stance, the slipping instant, the relieved stance), with trailing skull-moths and bell-spirals crossing panel boundaries; motion is implied by repeated hands, repeated antler angles, repeated chime-ribbons, yet everything is perfectly still, like a paused catastrophe that decided to become mercy. Fill every corner with paradoxical debris—miniature spiraling staircases tumbling end-over-end like toys, balcony curtains patterned with skull constellations, fungal light reflecting off steel-lace overlays, bells nesting in eye sockets, and a dense architectural crush with no empty sky. Hide an easter-egg **bakery wreath** subtly: a small pretzel-and-wheat wreath charm hanging from a distant balcony latch, nearly mistaken for funerary garland until noticed.
