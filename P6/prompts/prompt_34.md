Isometric cutaway view of a dense rooftop festival quarter stitched together by taut kite-bridges like tendons, every roof crowded with lantern stalls, drums, masks, wind-socks, prayer papers, and hanging chimes; at the center stands **the Avatar**, a mythic androgynous figure in contrapposto—half-draped in ceremonial ribbons and anklet bells, skin rendered as ornate collage—yet utterly still, as if time has snapped mid-breath: their body is **inside‑out**, the ribcage turned outward into an architectural cross-section where interior rooms and exterior rooftops exist simultaneously, showing a miniature festival-city nested within them (tiny dancers frozen mid-twirl on the “inside” while the “outside” streets lean inward like organs), and from the exposed inner architecture a single **First Blossom** grows impossibly from a healed scar, petals catching light like a vow; the Avatar’s hands, calm and resolute, hold two kite-bridge lines that should be tearing them apart but instead become luminous sutures—**resilience** made visible as the bridges strain, buildings buckle, and yet everything is quietly supported by their unmoving strength, implying catastrophic motion paused at the exact instant before collapse; spilled honey/syrup trails float in slow arcs through the air like amber calligraphy, threading between roofs and across the Avatar’s inverted anatomy, trapping sparks from frozen sparklers and firework trails that curve into constellations, while hundreds of tiny bells, chimes, and loose anklets orbit in layered depth, each caught mid-jingle with no empty space anywhere—corners stuffed with stacked kites, tangled strings, gold-leaf talismans, and paper lantern reflections; the sky is not a horizon but a **cosmic ceiling** pressed close, an awe-soaked vault of eclipse-light, auroral jewel tones, and impossible nebulae pouring down into alleys, making every shadow feel sacred and enormous; **CRITICAL texture rule**: apply **terracotta & olive wood** as flat, static 2D screen-tone patterns over all characters/objects (the pattern does not bend with folds or depth; it stays planar like cut paper sliding over 3D motion beneath), intensifying the Gankutsuou collage paradox; hide a subtle homage as a small **talking dog collar** charm tucked on an interior shelf within the cutaway rooms (easy to miss, a quiet reward), while the entire frame reads as a crowded visual riddle—vulnerability, endurance, and wonder suspended in one impossible frozen dream. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
