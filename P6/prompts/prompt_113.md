A velvet-curtained library-bedroom packed wall-to-wall with towering bookcases that melt into a four-poster bed, the entire architecture impossibly edible: spines become layered mille-feuille, shelves are dark rye and sugared lacquer, gilded filigree tastes like honeyed brass, and cracked plaster reveals marzipan ribcages of the room itself. At the center, an Oracle sits perfectly still on the bed like a patient idol in a paused catastrophe—spine straight, chin lowered, eyes half-lidded in deep calm, one bare shoulder and collarbone exposed like classical statuary under gold leaf; their hair drifts outward in a halo that is also a nest of vellum strips and curtain-fringe, and their skin bears healed seams that glow faintly as if recovery is an internal lantern. One hand cradles a wilting bouquet—petals browned, stems bruised—yet each droop becomes a quiet instrument of repair: fallen petals stitch themselves into torn fabric swatches midair, and the bouquet’s leaking pollen turns into tiny luminous sutures sealing cracks in books, walls, and the Oracle’s own ribs without ever moving, frozen at the instant before completion. Around them, physics breaks loudly: flora and fauna fuse into a crowded menagerie of impossible bedside life—orchids with moth wings, koi with fern fronds for tails, sparrows whose feathers are pressed leaves, rabbits sprouting ivy antlers—perched on pastry-books, drinking ink like medicine, their mouths full of blossoms and crumbs, all suspended as if held by a breath that never finishes. A spilled cup of “tea” is actually star-charting night, halted mid-splash, and within its arc float compass needles, sextants, and astrolabes like surgical tools in a calm operating theatre; some pierce nothing yet somehow align the room, others orbit the Oracle’s bouquet as if measuring grief’s recovery. The air is choked—beautifully—by floating feathers, ripped fabric swatches, patchwork scraps, torn curtain panels, and paper-lace annotations that crowd every corner: tiny scenes hide in the clutter (a book-page becoming a bandage around a snarling rose-lion’s paw; a bitten staircase of sponge-cake leading to a locked drawer full of teeth-shaped bookmarks; an astrolabe casting a shadow that looks like a healed scar). Serenity rules the color and light: cool moonlit aquas and velvety violets under calm gold, as if the room is a chapel to convalescence; no empty space, only layered foreground-midground-background riddles—yet the Oracle’s stillness makes the chaos feel tended, not violent, like recovery after a storm that never admits it happened. Crucially render the Gankutsuou collage effect: fire-and-ice-and-velvet-and-ash screen-tone textile patterns laid as perfectly flat 2D overlays on every 3D form (skin, curtains, animals, books, crumbs, instruments), refusing to bend with folds or perspective—static patterns sliding over moving volumes beneath, increasing the paradox while the frozen dream holds. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
