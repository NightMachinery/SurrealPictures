A frozen-dream frame inside a **grand midnight circus** where the entire world has **reversed gravity**: the **upper** half is a velvet-and-gold circus ring that behaves like a ceiling, with chandeliers, trapeze rigs, and masked patrons calmly “standing” upside-down on nothing; the **lower** half mirrors it as a second ring that behaves like a floor made of night-sky, so performers and props hang upward into darkness—both worlds split by a razor-thin horizontal seam like a stage mirror. At the seam, a **mythic ninja** (timeless, heavy with quiet history) is caught mid-step with impossible poise, one knee bent as if walking on air, bare shoulder revealed beneath layered, ceremonial shinobi robes; their mask is cracked porcelain stitched with gold, their sleeves trailing like ink-brush banners, their posture protective yet tender. They lean in **intimately** toward their own inverted counterpart reflected across the seam—foreheads almost touching, hands almost meeting—sharing a single breath suspended between worlds; the nearer hand cups an **enchanted rose** whose stem pierces the split like a key, its petals unfurling into tiny illuminated theater tickets and torn programs, each printed with unreadable vows. The rose’s glow doesn’t brighten the scene; it deepens the **serenity**, bathing everything in cool moonlit blues and quiet jewel tones, as if the circus is holding its breath. Crowd every plane: foreground corners packed with drifting **fallen crowns, tiara shards, confetti, streamers, curled ticket stubs, torn playbills**, all hovering in contradictory directions (some “falling” upward, some downward), weaving between floating lanterns, acrobats frozen mid-swing, and silent animal silhouettes rendered like cut-paper ornaments. Above, a **striped meteor canopy** arches overhead—multiple meteors like circus tent poles made of starlight, repeating in **kaleidoscopic quadrants** (four poster-like panels with intentional broken borders and misaligned repetitions), while the central ninja and rose rupture the symmetry. Enforce collage logic: stacked planes, mosaic partitions, mirrored architecture that doesn’t quite line up, occluding banners and ornate Art Nouveau frames that intrude into the image like a designed layout; no empty horizons, no quiet gaps—every negative space is filled with meaningful debris, patterned fabric, signage fragments, and watchful eyes. **CRITICAL texture rule:** apply **watercolors & ink** as a flat 2D screen-tone overlay across all forms (skin, cloth, metal, smoke), the pattern staying perfectly static and planar—**not bending with folds or depth**—so bodies and objects feel like moving sculpture beneath an unmoving collage skin. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
