Inside a human-sized abandoned dollhouse mansion (a rotting playhouse scaled up into a claustrophobic labyrinth of miniature staircases, nursery wallpaper, cracked lacquer floors, and too-small doorframes), a mythic Beast kneels in a frozen, unbearable embrace: a towering leonine-humanoid with cathedral antlers and bruised-gold eyes, half draped in a torn court mantle and half bare, the exposed body rendered like vulnerable marble; its posture is devotional yet predatory, shoulders hunched as if shielding something precious from the room itself. The Beast holds intimacy like contraband—one massive hand cupping the nape of a smaller figure made only of projected memory: a translucent lover/child/self assembled from overlapping diorama-scenes (tiny birthday candles, a first kiss, a funeral veil, a hand slipping away), each “memory” appearing as a literal object that refuses to stay symbolic—wet handwriting crawling across skin, a lullaby as visible ribbon binding wrists, a regret as a thorned garland tightening around throats—yet all motion is arrested mid-event, as if time snapped shut. The mansion reacts to closeness: walls bow inward like ribs, dollhouse rooms compress into stacked planes, and the air crowds with relics pulled out of the Beast’s chest—perfume bottles uncorked and hovering, atomized mist blooming into faces, butterfly pins and jeweled brooches orbiting like verdicts, sparklers and firework trails hanging in suspended arcs that stitch foreground to background, every corner packed with glittering debris, broken porcelain dolls, gilt frames, and needle-pricked lace. A hearth fire is physically present and multiplicitous—tiny fireplaces embedded in impossible places (inside a wardrobe, beneath a crib, within a cracked teacup), their flames frozen like molten petals, casting dread-light that is warm in color but cold in intent; the glow outlines the embrace as both sanctuary and trap. Memory projection is not subtle: the Beast’s shadow is a projector screen, throwing living scenes onto the mansion’s surfaces—on one wall a wedding dress burns without burning, on another a childhood bedroom repeats endlessly like a tiled pattern, and on the Beast’s own torso a projected mouth whispers against projected skin, intimacy made literal and therefore terrifying. Enforce the Gankutsuou collage paradox: coral & pearl screen-tone patterns lie perfectly flat across bodies, fabric, mist, and architecture as static 2D overlays that do not bend with folds or depth—ornate coral lattices and pearlescent dot matrices sliding over 3D forms like pasted paper, intensifying the sense that reality is a costume. Telephoto compression viewpoint from a cramped hallway: foreground cluttered with a toppled dollhouse chandelier, floating brooches inches from the lens, and a perfume atomizer mid-spray; midground dominated by the Beast and its impossible embrace; background stacked with receding doll-rooms full of pinned butterflies, frozen fireworks, and watching empty doll eyes—no negative space, only crowded planes, gilded detail, and creeping unease as if the house is learning how to hold them closer.
