A mossy hydroelectric chapel carved into a mountain cavern, where turbine-wheels serve as stained-glass halos and rivulets of glacial water run through copper pipes like veins; at the altar stands an ancient Vizier—mythic, ageless, heavy with responsibility—kneeling yet towering, spine arched in quiet defiance, one hand extended in a gesture of blessing that looks suspiciously like begging, the other clutching a ledger bound in skin-thin vellum that flutters like wings; their face is veiled in a flat, unbending collage of oil-paint-and-pixel screen-tone patterns that ignore every contour, sliding over cheekbones, jewelry, and cloth as if the body beneath is moving while the texture remains a pasted 2D mask; their robes are impossible brocade—static textile panels hovering a finger-width off the body, exposing fragments of vulnerable bare skin like a classical statue half-undressed by the draft of prayer—yet the fabric refuses to fold, as though the Vizier is trapped inside a cutout of their own authority. The chapel is mid-Thanksgiving feast, but gratitude has turned physical: an immense feast table is fused into the architecture, extending like a bridge between pews and penstocks, its surface crowded with gilded bread, pomegranates split like hearts, bowls of glowing broth, and candlesticks that drip not wax but tiny handwritten thank-you notes; every place setting holds an empty plate that reflects not the room, but a distant silhouette the viewer can’t reach. The defining impossibility is containment shattered: the tablecloth is a “container” that cannot contain—its embroidered border becomes a rimless bowl spilling upward, while tureens and chalices hold entire rooms inside them (miniature chapels, miniature caverns, miniature feasts), and simultaneously leak their contents into the air as frozen arcs—gravy suspended as amber prisms, wine hovering in ruby ribbons, steam crystallized into script—so that inside and outside trade places; a single pumpkin pie contains a whole mountain night sky, while the cavern itself feels like it’s trapped under a glass cloche that has already cracked. Foreground chaos: sewing needles drift like compass points, catching bioluminescent spores; thread spools roll without touching the floor, trailing lines that stitch the Vizier’s shadow to the far end of the table where a chair sits turned away, eternally unoccupied; unraveling ribbons coil around turbine blades, tying gratitude into knots that look like restraints; moss-lit mushrooms and electric-blue fungi sprout from hymnals and fuse boxes, illuminating lost silverware, cracked prayer beads, and tiny carved turkeys nested in pipe joints like relics. Midground: worshippers are implied but absent—only their clothing remains, hanging in midair as flat patterned silhouettes, sleeves reaching for plates they can’t touch; napkins float like surrendered flags; a chorus loft is packed with dangling keys, broken cutlery, and waterlogged letters of thanks, all pinned to the air by needles as if the atmosphere itself were fabric. Background: the hydroelectric machinery becomes a cathedral organ, its pipes exhaling light; waterfalls pour upward into turbines that are also moons; gold leaf flecks drift through damp darkness like a ruined halo. Color and lighting ache with longing—jewel-toned gloom, cold cavern blues versus feverish gold, a distant warm glow at the far end of the table that never gets closer—while the Vizier’s outstretched hand almost, almost touches a hovering platter that holds a single unreachable seat of light, the entire scene paused at the exact second gratitude tries to become possession and fails.
