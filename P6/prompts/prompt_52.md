Inside a collapsed opera house whose velvet balconies hang like broken jaws, phosphorescent ivy floods every crack and crawls across the proscenium as if the building is trying to re-stage itself; the entire catastrophe is paused mid-impossible event: shattered chandeliers float upward in slow reverse while their candle wax continues to drip downward in thick, glossy strands that harden into stalactites over midair. Center frame, a mythic Therapist advances without flinching—barefoot on a mosaic of torn playbills and cracked concrete, spine straight, chin lifted—wearing a clinician’s coat that is also a ceremonial mantle, half-unbuttoned to reveal vulnerable, classical nudity beneath (skin treated like marble and bruise, intimate but not pornographic), pockets spilling folded notes like feathers; their expression is calm in the face of ugliness, a practiced tenderness turned into armor. The grotesque/uncanny is literalized: therapy metaphors become matter—above them, a gigantic OPEN HAND (totem and architecture at once) is fused into the ceiling like a saint’s reliquary, palm facing the viewer; each finger is a theater box-seat, each nail a tiny spotlight, and within the palm sits a miniature stage where a mouthless choir of porcelain masks “listens” with stitched ears, their smiles cracked, their tears crystallized into perfume bottles that tumble and shatter into atomized mist. The Therapist mirrors the ceiling-hand with their own open hand thrust forward (fearless advance), but physics is broken into a blunt literal metaphor: the open hand is a door, and its lifeline is an actual corridor—an incision in reality—through which a river of confetti, clinical paperwork, and origami boats/paper ships pours into the opera house like a flood of “processed feelings,” each paper boat carrying a tiny lit candle that should be burning but is frozen mid-flicker, wax suspended like pearls. Decorative border motifs invade the interior: gilded Art Nouveau frames, ticket-stub filigree, and mosaic cartouches crawl from the edges of the composition into the scene, pinning figures into stacked planes like a collage poster—corners crowded with ivy-wrapped armchairs that resemble ribcages, toppled therapy couches upholstered in carnival-glass patterns, and neon-lit stage ropes that knot into anatomical diagrams; in the wings, mannequins in opera costumes hold out open hands filled with teeth, keys, and tiny mirrors, while a cracked mirror-diptych on the back wall shows the same Therapist both approaching and already gone, creating a paradox of arrival. Fill every gap with debris and clues: perfume atom mist halos the Therapist like breath made visible; wax drips thread through floating sheet music; confetti sticks to wet concrete; paper ships snag in ivy; spotlight beams become solid ribbons you could climb; small open-hand symbols repeat everywhere—on torn gloves, on ivy leaves shaped like palms, on a surgeon’s diagram painted on the stage floor—so the viewer can’t decide whether the Therapist is rescuing the opera house, being birthed by it, or calmly walking into the very wound they’re meant to heal. Color and lighting should embody courage: a forward-driving gold-and-jewel-toned key light slices through sickly phosphor greens and bruised violets, making the Therapist’s advance feel inevitable rather than triumphant; keep the frame maximalist and claustrophobically detailed, no empty horizons, every corner holding a secondary story. CRITICAL: apply a flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone overlay of carnival glass + confetti + neon + concrete across all 3D forms (faces, bodies, ivy, rubble, mist), the pattern staying perfectly static and not bending with folds or perspective, creating a cut-paper “moving beneath a fixed texture” collage effect. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
