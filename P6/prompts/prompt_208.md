A crowded, border-heavy single-card diptych fused into one image: inside a **conservatory of bottled weather specimens**—towering glass cabinets packed with labeled vials of thunderstorms, miniature auroras, corked fog, folded lightning like origami, snow globes that bleed sand—an **Idol** stands mythic and intimate at the center, half-concealed behind a theatrical apparatus of hanging mask-frames, mirrored panels, brass lab stands, and veils of stitched iconography; their posture is devotional yet exhausted (chin lifted as if receiving a coronation, one hand gently cupping an unseen face), with tasteful classical nudity partly wrapped in ceremonial textiles, the expression unreadable because **every visible face is a mask**: porcelain, theater cloth, insect carapace, lovers’ lace, each mask reflecting a different “truth” in nearby mirrors. Reality is **broken by overt Fragmentation**: the Idol’s body and the conservatory itself are split into crisp floating shards—planes of floor, shelves, and window-lattice hovering like cut paper—yet all fragments are held together by slow, tender **trails of spilled honey/syrup** that arc through the air like affectionate ligaments, catching warm lamplight; the syrup drips across chalked **diagrams and summoning circles** drawn over shattered tiles, equations turning into love letters, sigils smudged by bare footprints that never touched the ground. **Zahhak’s shoulder serpents** are physically present as twin living totems: one coiled like a jeweled stole around the Idol’s shoulder-blade, the other fused into the conservatory architecture as a carved serpent-gargoyle that exhales tiny bottled storms; their eyes are not threatening but mournfully protective, mirroring the scene’s **tenderness**—a gentle, golden-pink glow like forgiveness after confession—while the corners remain densely packed with floating rocks/islands, dangling labels, cracked perfume bottles of rain, ribboned reliquaries, overlapping poster-panels, mosaic borders, and stacked planes that flatten depth into designed collage. Make the **illusion/mask theme** infect the environment: bottles wear miniature masks, clouds inside jars form faces, reflections disagree, and the “empty” spaces are filled with filigree, diagrams, and drifting fragments—no blank background anywhere. Hide a subtle Easter egg: a **black cat in a small cage** tucked on a high shelf (or repeated as a tiny motif in a rug pattern), noticeable only on close inspection. **CRITICAL Gankutsuou texture rule**: overlay **static 2D screen-tone patterns of gemstones & rust** across skin, fabric, glass, and architecture—flat collage textures that do *not* follow folds or perspective, as if the scene moves beneath a printed tapestry. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
