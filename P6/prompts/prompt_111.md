Inside an interdimensional ferry terminal made of velvet corridors that loop like intestines—ticket windows shaped like ribcages, departure boards written in extinct alphabets, brass turnstiles blooming into Art Nouveau vines—the viewer stands inches from the scene (ultra‑wide lens distortion, curving edges, warped perspective) as a mythic healer-avatar pauses mid‑gesture: a tall, androgynous presence with a calm, exhausted gaze, half-robed in a translucent clinic kimono stitched from antique maps, one shoulder bare like a classical statue, skin luminous with faint scar-constellations; their posture is both offering and surrender, one palm open as if releasing their own heart, the other hand pressed to a stranger’s sternum without touching—an impossible mercy suspended before impact. From the open palm spills the “gift”: not coins, but warmth made visible—golden threads of compassion that knit torn air, suturing small tragedies across the crowd; the threads wrap around frightened commuters and cracked masks, quietly repairing them, turning shame into soft light. The defining paradox is weather containment: a full thunderstorm is trapped in a hanging glass reliquary the size of a suitcase—rain beating against invisible walls, lightning coiled like a captive ribbon, hailstones hovering as a frozen rosary—while elsewhere snow is bottled in lanterns, a sunset is folded into a paper envelope, and a cyclone turns silently inside a teacup on the information desk; droplets and sunbeams slam into their boundaries and stop, as if the terminal is a museum of confiscated climates. The compass rose is physically present and unavoidable: inlaid huge in the velvet-marble floor beneath the healer’s feet, its needles rotated to impossible directions; a second, smaller compass rose amulet is held between two fingers like a surgical instrument, its points bleeding gold leaf that becomes the healing threads. Crowd the frame with narrative debris and quiet chaos: origami boats/paper ships drift through the air like a flock, some sailing on levitating puddles that never spill, others snagged in chandeliers; migrating butterflies sweep through the corridors in thick swarms, their wings patterned like fractured mirrors, landing on lips, tickets, and mask fragments; masks on hooks line the walls like a waiting audience—some intact, some shattered into porcelain shards that orbit faces as if remembering who wore them. In the corners: a porter made of stitched velvet carries a crate labeled “MONSOON—FRAGILE” that drips upward; a child-sized silhouette offers a paper ship to an old, faceless uniform; a ferry door yawns open to a starless sea of curtains; behind everything, the corridor itself seems to inhale, consuming and birthing passengers in the same breath. Make every surface and figure obey the Gankutsuou collage rule: apply a flat 2D screen‑tone overlay of **sand & mirrors** (grainy dunes + reflective shards) across characters, fabric, skin, glass, and architecture—**the pattern stays static and planar, never bending with folds or depth, as if pasted on top while the 3D forms move beneath it**—creating shimmering dissonance; no empty space, dense foreground/midground/background clutter, layered signage, hooks, boats, butterflies, fragments, and contained weather artifacts everywhere; lighting and color grade radiate healing warmth (jewel-toned ambers, compassionate golds, soft reds) while the trapped storms stay cold and cruel behind their glass, posing the question: is the gift a rescue, a theft, or a redistribution of pain?
