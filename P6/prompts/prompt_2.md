A frozen dream-frame inside an interdimensional ferry terminal made of endless velvet corridors and ticket-archways: the **Avatar** stands on the threshold of a boarding gate shaped like a wound in space, tall and mythic, bare-shouldered with classical, vulnerable nudity partly veiled by a heavy cloak stitched from obsolete ferry tickets and mourning-black lace; their posture is both regal and emptied-out—chin lifted as if listening for footsteps that will never return, one hand pressed to the throat, the other gripping a spool of **Ariadne’s thread** that unravels into the architecture. The terminal itself performs the paradox of **soft sculpture**: concrete columns sag like warm taffy, neon wayfinding signs droop like soaked ribbons, a marble information desk billows like a bedsheet caught mid-fall, and the velvet corridors harden into knife-edged stone folds—everything captured mid-collapse yet perfectly still, as if time pinned the moment with a needle. The Ariadne thread snakes everywhere—suturing torn doorways, looping through turnstiles, lacing up a floating staircase, tethering a phantom ferry (its hull a draped curtain of “stone-velvet”) that hovers inches from the platform without ever arriving; the thread knots into tiny constellations that resemble missing names, and where it tightens, the world puckers like fabric. Abandonment is everywhere but never empty: abandoned **lace gloves** cling to railings like shed skins, single **silk stockings** hang from a departure board that reads in unreadable glyphs, **ripped fabric swatches / patchwork scraps** whirl in slow suspension like migrating flags, **drifting rose petals** and a few **nightingales** orbit the Avatar as if trapped in an unseen draft—birds with open beaks that will not sing, petals that will not land. In the corners: a bench upholstered in velvet-concrete slumps into a kneeling shape; a forgotten suitcase leaks stitched memories (threads, petals, ticket stubs) that never touch the floor; a puddle reflects a crowd that isn’t there; the ceiling is a vaulted tapestry of corridors leading nowhere, dense with doors, signage, and braided thread like a labyrinth diagram turned physical. Mood and color: melancholy, beautiful grief—low terminal light like late-night gold, bruised violets and deep teals, iridescent highlights that feel like tears caught in neon; the air is crowded with texture and meaning, no negative space, every inch a clue. Hidden whisper: **orange marigold petals** appear only as a subtle inlay pattern in the floor mosaic near the edge of the frame (a small, discoverable halo around a single knot of thread), not the focus. **CRITICAL texture instruction**: apply a flat, static 2D screen-tone collage overlay of **beeswax & parchment & neon & concrete** across all forms (skin, velvet, stone, signage, petals, birds) so the pattern remains perfectly unwarped and unmoving while the 3D shapes exist beneath it, creating a cut-paper surreal opulence; wide-angle, deep-focus, maximalist foreground/midground/background, gallery-quality illustration. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
