Inside a floating customs office for dream travelers—an impossible Art Nouveau bureaucracy suspended in a star-choked atrium—every surface is overcrowded with passport drawers, confession ledgers, velvet ropes, hanging seals, telescopic stamp-arms, and translucent filing cabinets that contain miniature dawns. At the center stands a mythic Therapist as if carved from quiet authority: androgynous, ageless, barefoot on a gilded inspection dais, torso partially nude beneath a severe high-collared cloak pinned with dozens of butterfly brooches like captured epiphanies; one hand is raised in a clinical gesture of listening, the other grips a spinning wheel whose thread is not yarn but a literal ribbon of spoken sentences—inked words physically unspooling into the air, frozen mid-whirl as though time has been stopped at the peak of revelation. The thread stitches itself into a doorway that should not exist: a radiant Sunrise Gate shaped like an arch of rising light, yet it casts a shadow of midnight; the threshold is simultaneously open and sealed, because the “door” is made of stamped visas, wet with gold wax, fluttering like moth wings while remaining perfectly still, mid-fall. Around the Therapist, the literal metaphor breaks physics: emotions are contraband objects—AWE is a heavy, glowing commodity in crates marked “FRAGILE: COSMIC”—and regret is a customs officer’s rubber stamp, hovering inches above a trembling forehead without ever landing; a therapy couch folds into a portal frame, its upholstery becoming a border checkpoint where memories queue in line as suitcases with beating hearts inside. Pack the foreground with open, empty birdcages drifting like discarded halos, their doors yawning outward into nothing; crowd the midground with dancing silhouettes—paper-thin figures in formalwear and hospital gowns—waltzing in silence around stanchions, their feet never touching the floor; jam the background with stacked balconies of clerks wearing masks of sunrise, shelves of bottled sleep, and chandeliers made of compass needles pointing toward “HOME,” all suspended in a vaulted cosmos where constellations press against the windows like curious faces. In corners and negative spaces, hide the whisper of great white wolf fur as a subtle plush pelt pattern on a rug beneath the dais (only visible on second look), and as pale tufts caught in a drawer handle like an omen. Lighting should feel like cathedral-scale dawn colliding with deep space—iridescent, reverent, terrifyingly tender—so the whole scene reads as a frozen dream at the instant before the threshold decides whether to admit or devour the soul. CRITICAL: render with the Gankutsuou texture rule—oil paint & pixels as a flat 2D screen-tone overlay that does NOT bend with folds or depth, creating collage-like patterned silhouettes sliding beneath a static textile skin. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
