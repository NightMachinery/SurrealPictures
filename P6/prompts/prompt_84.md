A mythic Storyteller stands at the throat of a funerary avenue lined with tier upon tier of silent, crowded balconies—an amphitheater for the dead—caught in a frozen mid-step as if time has just been pinched shut: their bare back half-revealed beneath a heavy ceremonial cloak that slips like a second shadow, one arm cradling a massive hourglass against their chest as though it were a lover, the other hand pressed to their own mouth in a hush that feels intimate and accusatory at once; the hourglass is alive—its glass ribs breathe, its sand forms tiny grasping hands, and the narrow waist of the vessel leans into the Storyteller’s throat, begging to be kissed—while nearby objects are unmistakably personified and complicit: empty picture frames sprout eyelids and lean inward like gossiping faces, balcony railings become interlaced fingers trying to clasp each other across the street, party hats bow like mourners, paper crowns curl into shy smiles, stray earrings hover like attentive ears, hairpins and combs flutter like anxious insects, and a thousand small ornaments drift in dense spirals that stitch foreground to midground to background with no void left unoccupied; intimacy is shown as a physical force—buildings press together too closely, balconies inhale toward the center, streetlamps bend their necks to eavesdrop, and every inanimate thing attempts to touch—yet the paradox holds: the avenue is funerary, but the lighting detonates with vitality, jewel-toned radiance and iridescent gold bursting from within cracks of stone like blooming veins; overhead, constellations fracture and fall as flat, unbending screen-tone sheets—constellation-and-void patterns sliding over faces, skin, cloth, marble, and glass without wrapping to folds or depth, a collage overlay that stays stubbornly 2D while the 3D world strains beneath it—making every caress look borrowed, every closeness slightly impossible; in the corners, the silent balconies conceal half-seen onlookers made of furniture and drapery, their “eyes” embedded in brooches and frame corners, while the Storyteller’s lips are stained with starlight-sand as if they’ve been swallowing time to keep the embrace from ending, the whole scene paused at the exact instant before either tenderness becomes consumption or grief becomes celebration.
