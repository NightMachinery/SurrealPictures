From a behind-the-curtain vantage, the viewer peers through layers of translucent gauze and embroidered stage scrims—milky textiles beaded with condensation like tears—into a frozen instant on an impossible proscenium where gratitude glows as honeyed backlight. Center stage stands a mythic Rationalist–Matchmaker: a tall, androgynous figure with a calm, merciless posture, bare shoulders half-draped in a magistrate’s coat stitched from map-grid vellum; one hand holds a brass compass and the other threads a needle of light through two hovering wedding rings that are also Möbius bands. Their face is mostly silhouette, but the rim-light reveals inked proofs and tiny handwritten thank-you notes crawling across their skin like constellations, as if devotion has become mathematics.

Physics is broken by blatant fragmentation: the stage, the figure, and the air itself are shattered into suspended slices—clean cut panels floating inches apart—yet every fragment remains perfectly aligned as if time paused mid-explosion; within the gaps, you can see a second contradictory scene continuing behind it (a tender embrace that is also a surgical diagram), suggesting union through division. The entire world is skinned in the Gankutsuou collage effect: origami and paper screen-tone patterns lie flat and unmoving across 3D forms (the pattern does not wrap or bend), making bodies, curtains, feathers, and architecture wear the same static paper texture while they “move” beneath it.

No empty space: marionette lines crisscross like a star chart, tangling with a flying kite whose tail is made of torn theater tickets and shredded programs; each ticket is stamped with dates that don’t exist. Snowglobes drift like slow meteors, each containing a mini diorama of the same stage in smaller scales, recursive and crowded, some cracked and leaking glittering “thanks” in gold dust. Above and woven into the rigging, a Simurgh is physically present—part bird, part chandelier, part origami phoenix—its wings a dense halo of jewel-toned paper feathers and gilded filigree, backlit so it crowns the matchmaker in a radiant object-halo that reads as blessing and burden. The corners teem with props: broken masks, ribboned bouquets tied to pulleys, folded love letters becoming architectural beams, mirrored pairs of hands reaching across the fragment gaps; the overall mood is overflowing, warm, and reverent, as if the entire theater is exhaling gratitude at once.
