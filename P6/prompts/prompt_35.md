Inside a colossal frozen waterfall, a snowbound monastery has been hollowed into the ice like a reliquary-womb: cloisters, stairwells, and chapels stacked too tightly to breathe, every arch choked with icicles that resemble organ pipes. At the center, on a narrow balcony altar, a mythic Inventor leans forward as if about to step off—bare shoulders and chest partly exposed beneath an impossible coat of lacquered brocade and brass vertebrae, the posture both ecstatic and exhausted, hands raised in the instant after a breakthrough and before the fall. From their spine unfurls a half-built flight apparatus: wing-frames stitched from broken violin strings, instrument ribs, and domino tiles; dice and game tokens click into place midair as if obeying a silent theorem, yet everything is frozen in a single suspended frame. The act of liberation is happening without moving: shackles of ice have just snapped open around the Inventor’s ankles, the shattered links hovering like halos, while pages from schematic books burst outward and hang like white birds caught in resin.

Physics is openly violated by **weather containment**: blizzards are trapped in glass lanterns and reliquary spheres, thunderheads folded into gilded boxes, a bolt of lightning corkscrewing inside a monk’s censer, sunbeams imprisoned in a bone-carved astrolabe that leaks a blinding, euphoric glow. Snow falls upward in strict columns as if poured back into the sky; rain is braided into rosary strands; wind is pinned to the walls like tapestry. The monastery itself participates—windows open onto storms that cannot escape, and the frozen waterfall becomes a cathedral curtain holding whole climates behind it, each “room” lit by a different captive season.

The Simurgh is physically present and unavoidable yet ambiguous: a monumental mosaic-bird embedded in the apse, its feathers rendered as overlapping mechanical plates, and a smaller, living Simurgh-like automaton perches on the Inventor’s forearm offering a key made of ice and gold (is it granting freedom, or locking it?). In the corners and along every ledge, **pomegranate seeds** scatter like rubies across snow and gold leaf, some floating as a constellation that outlines a hidden exit; dominoes tumble in slow spirals; violin pegs and splintered varnished wood drift like shrapnel from a beautiful sacrifice. Monastic figures crowd the background in layered silhouettes—some praying, some laughing with eyes shut in blinding joy, some levitating inches above the floor as if the Inventor’s device has already rewritten gravity—while chandeliers of frozen droplets refract the scene into countless paradoxes.

Hide an Easter egg: a subtle flying-carpet pattern woven into a small rug on a side altar (or echoed faintly in a cloud trapped in a jar), noticeable only on second glance. Color and light communicate **euphoria**: auroral jewel tones, radiant gold, ecstatic glare bouncing off ice, every surface over-ornamented so no negative space survives. Crucially enforce the Gankutsuou collage rule: overlay all major forms (skin, cloth, ice, machinery, architecture) with a **flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone** of *floral chintz & bone* that does **not** follow folds or depth—rigid patterned planes sliding over 3D bodies beneath, creating unsettling opulent dissonance. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
