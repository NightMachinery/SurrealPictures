A frozen dream-frame: a mythic Widow stands barefoot on the lip of a colossal **wishing well** that is also the foundation of a drifting, cutaway “home”—its rooms hover like mismatched dollhouse chambers around her in impossible orbit, each room facing a different sky, while a quiet hearth-fire burns upside-down in a ceiling and a rain of glass beads falls upward into open drawers; her posture is calm, sovereign, and heavy with time—one hand resting on her abdomen as if holding a private absence, the other lowering a wedding veil into the well like a net; her gown is half-mourning couture, half-architectural shelter: layered parasols and umbrella ribs form a protective dome-cape around her shoulders, yet portions peel away to reveal tasteful classical nudity and vulnerable skin, as if “home” is both armor and exposure; everywhere, **shelter** is literalized—walls become blankets, blankets become rooftops, rooftops become wings—yet none of it obeys physics: doorways open onto oceans, staircases end in pillows, windows look inward at strangers who are the same woman at different ages, all suspended in perfect stillness mid-collapse, mid-assembly. Apply **Persian tilework & lapis lazuli** as a static 2D screen-tone collage overlay on all major forms (her skin, veil, umbrellas, stone, furniture, floating rooms): the pattern remains flat and unmoving, refusing to wrap with folds or depth, as if the world’s texture is a pasted tapestry sliding over living sculpture. Crowd every inch: foreground marbles and prism drops scatter like frozen hail on ornate floor tiles; midair swarms of watching orbs (some embedded in pearls, some inside glass marbles) stare from teacups, keyholes, picture frames, and umbrella canopies; background is dense with balconies, rugs, hanging keys, drifting curtains, and a chandelier made of tiny wells, all packed into an opulent labyrinth with no empty space. The emotional grade is **contentment in perfect stillness**—warm, luminous gold and deep lapis serenity, soft halo lighting, gentle shadows, a tranquil smile that makes the catastrophe feel like a cozy ritual. Hide the whisper: on a corner rug-map near the well, a small brass **magic lamp** sits beside a grinning trickster figurine; its faint smoke curls into delicate border-lines and chesslike territories across the textile pattern, hinting at shifting geopolitical stakes—subtle, easily missed, a reward for the patient viewer. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
