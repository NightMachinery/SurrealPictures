An isometric cutaway of a cathedral-sized mentor’s atelier fused to an airship’s hull and a crumbling townhouse—interior rooms and exterior night sky shown at once like a dollhouse split open—everything mid-catastrophe yet perfectly still: at the central threshold stands the Mentor, ageless and intimate, a tall figure with a calm, ruinous posture (one bare shoulder exposed like a confession, the rest wrapped in an impossibly heavy robe woven from the **Golden Fleece** itself—threads of real gold wool stitched into constellations, draped over banisters and braided through ribbed arches), their face serene with beautiful grief as they gently extend a hand toward a pupil who is not fully present (only a shadow, only a reflection in glass, only a footprint in floating dust). The paradox of liberation erupts silently through **anatomical impossibility**: the Mentor’s back is open like a reliquary, revealing not organs but a nested series of winged torsos inside torsos—human scapulae blooming into folded sails, extra arms sprouting from the collarbones to tie knots in the air, a spine that becomes a ladder of feathered keys—suggesting that flight is taught by being disassembled; their tears hang in place as suspended droplets of molten brass that harden into tiny bells. The environment reacts as if gravity has been forgiven: staircases unhook and hover like paper cranes, window frames peel away into feather-shapes, a bookshelf exhales trapped sky, and the roof has split into a frozen updraft where furniture, letters, and bones rise without moving, as though the building itself is learning to let go. Crowd every surface with intimate debris: dripping candle wax forms white stalactites and wax rivers that climb upward against logic; hundreds of tiny vials and elixirs (opal, ink-black, sunrise-red) float in halos around the Mentor like a pharmacology of memories; snowglobes spin in slow suspension, each containing a miniature diorama of the same scene with different outcomes (a smaller mentor falling upward, a smaller pupil already gone), their glass catching grief like dew. In the corners: a cracked mirror shows the exterior city upside down; a cutaway bedroom where sheets billow like parachutes; a chapel alcove where the Golden Fleece is nailed as a votive pelt; a workbench cluttered with wing-pattern blueprints, broken compasses, and a jar of captured dawn. Hidden as a whisper, not a centerpiece: a subtle **lantern-festival** motif appears as a faded pattern on a rug and as tiny paper lantern shapes trapped inside one snowglobe, glowing faintly like a memory-triggering revelation. Color-grade the whole frozen dream in twilight indigo and bruised violets with mournful, iridescent gold highlights, dense particulate air, and zero empty space; every silhouette and object must carry a flat, collage-like **marble & moss** screen-tone overlay that stays perfectly 2D and unmapped to form (the pattern does not bend with folds or depth), making the living scene feel like a luxurious lie. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
