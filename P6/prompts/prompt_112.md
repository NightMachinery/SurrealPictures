A frozen, mid-catastrophe frame inside an impossibly long palace corridor of repeating arches and nested doorframes, each opening into another vanishing point like a hall of mirrors; at the central convergence stands **the Idol**—a timeless, androgynous figure with a serene, exhausted gaze, barefoot on a tilting mosaic floor that sags like a hammock under their mere presence, hips cocked in classical contrapposto, one shoulder draped in a regal mantle that should be velvet but is visibly **transmuting** into cold **steel lace** mid-air; their skin and garments are overlaid with a **flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone pattern of “lace & steel” that does not follow folds or perspective**, as if a collage sheet were pinned over a living body that shifts beneath it; gravity is made visible as a theatrical force—ornate balustrades bow toward the Idol, chandeliers hang sideways, and the corridor’s tiles ripple in concentric “weight-waves,” while weightless things become heavy and heavy things become buoyant: marble statues in side niches turn to soft lace doilies with metallic edges, drifting upward, while floating parasols suddenly thud down like anvils, denting the air itself; the Idol is **partly hidden behind symbolic apparatus**—a towering clockwork reliquary/astrolabe-loom hybrid that cages them in rings of gilt geometry, its spokes jammed with **broken clock gears** and tiny dangling **bells, chimes, and anklets** that hover inches apart, perfectly still, as if sound has been paused; a **half-burned candle** is wedged into the apparatus like a key, its flame petrified mid-flicker, wax flowing upward in defiance of gravity and crystallizing into lace-patterned steel icicles that thread through the rings; foreground clutter crowds the frame—close-up parasol ribs, bell tassels, gear teeth, and ribbon-like steel filigree occluding the lower corners—while midground debris forms swirling constellations around the Idol’s torso, and in the far background every receding doorway repeats the same scene with slight, unsettling variations (a mirrored Idol, a missing candle, an umbrella blooming into a shackle), turning the corridor into a puzzle of contradictory realities; lighting is playful and absurdly sumptuous—jewel-toned highlights, iridescent gold glints, candy-colored shadows—so the mood reads as whimsical even while the architecture buckles, as if the universe is performing a flirtatious magic trick about burden, devotion, and the cost of being worshiped.
