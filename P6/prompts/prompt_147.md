A “Frozen Dream” frame: on a narrow ferry-boat carved from **concrete that pours like water**, a mythic Hermit-Ferryman stands mid-transfer, one foot on the prow, one on a suspended stepping-stone, posture calm but burdened—an ageless figure with a shaved head and salt-stiff beard, draped in a heavy cloak that slips off one shoulder to reveal vulnerable, classical skin marked by faint healed sutures; their oar is a long staff made from a **stopped clock** (glass face cracked, hands frozen at an unreadable hour) that they wield like both paddle and crutch. The “river” is **solid liquidity**: slabs of stone ripple in slow waves, marble droplets hang in the air like paused rain, and a basalt whirlpool is frozen mid-splash, its splash-crown holding floating debris—**scattered love letters, postcards, ribbon-wrapped gifts, unopened boxes**—as if the current is a mischievous archivist. Healing/recovery is everywhere but never literal: torn letters fold into bandages around broken architecture, wax-sealed envelopes stitch themselves into bridges over the flowing stone, and **moss-lit mushrooms / bioluminescent fungi** grow from cracks like luminous sutures, lighting the scene with gleeful trouble—playful neon greens and golds that make the ruins look like they’re giggling at their own collapse. In the crowded foreground, a cascade of postcards becomes a shoal of paper-fish circling the ferryman’s ankles; ribbon tails coil like curious serpents around the oar; an unopened gift box leaks a soft glow that seems to “mend” the air. Midground: a cathedral-arch made of stacked clocks is halted mid-fall, each face stopped at a different silent minute, their numbers peeling off into the stone-stream; a half-submerged nude figure (ambiguous—patient, statue, lover, ghost) reaches upward through liquid-rock as if being recovered from time itself, fingertips almost touching the ferryman’s clock-staff. Background: a city of parchment walls and neon veins, concrete balconies sprouting fungi-lanterns, windows stuffed with letters like organs, every corner busy with hovering scraps, drifting wax seals, and hanging stone droplets—**no empty space**, every surface telling a different part of the same paradox. Apply a **flat, unmoving 2D screen-tone overlay** of **beeswax & parchment & neon & concrete** textures across all forms (characters, cloth, stone, water) that does **not** bend with depth or folds, creating a rigid collage-pattern sliding over living volume; sharp lines, opulent clutter, mischief in the lighting, tenderness in the wounds that are already closing—an image that asks: who is healing whom, and what does the ferryman refuse to let time carry away. Illustration Style: in the style of Gankutsuou and Gustav Klimt, rich static textile patterns layered over character silhouettes, iridescent gold leaf and jewel tones, texture mapping, ornate Art Nouveau details, collage-like flatness, surreal opulence, sharp distinct lines, psychedelic baroque, maximalist composition, highly detailed background, aspect ratio 2:3
